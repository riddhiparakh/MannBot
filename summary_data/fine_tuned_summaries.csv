02-Nov-14,"The author reflects on the importance of cleanliness in India after the recent Diwali festival. He urges people to change their mindset and seek opportunities to do their bit. The author also mentions his personal experience of encouraging people to buy khadi outfits and seeing a significant increase in sales. Cleanliness has become a huge public movement, and the government is taking concrete actions to remove huge garbage piles. Additionally, the campaign has had a great influence on kids, who are now picking up trash and disposing it themselves. Finally, the author expresses his satisfaction that the general public has started feeling responsible for their surroundings and will not add to the existing dirt.",02-nov-2014 my dear fellow countrymen i am with you again almost after a month a month is quite a long time lots of things keep happening in the world you all have recently celebrated the festival of diwali with great fervour and joy it is these festivals which bring happiness in our daily lives from time to time be it poor or rich people from village or from urban areas festivals hold a different significance in everyone s lives this is my first meeting after diwali so i convey my very warm wishes to you all last time we had some general conversation but then i came to some new realizations after that conversation sometimes we think leave it nothing is going to change people are indifferent they will not do anything our country is like this from my last conversation in mann ki baat to this one i would urge you all to change this mindset neither is our country is like this nor our people indifferent sometimes i feel the nation is way ahead and the government is lacking behind and from my personal experience i will say that the governments too needs to change their mindsets and i say that because i can see tremendous sense of commitment in the indian youth they are very eager to do their bit and are just seeking an opportunity where they can do their bit and they are making efforts at their own end last time i had asked them to buy at least one khadi outfit i had not asked anyone to be khadidhari but the feedback i got from khadi stores was that in a week s time the sales had jumped up by 125 in this way as compared to last year the sales this year is more than double in the week following 2nd oct this means the people of our country is many times more than we think of i salute all my fellow indians cleanliness can anyone imagine that cleanliness will become a such a huge public movement the expectations are high and they should be so i can see some good results cleanliness can now be witnessed in two parts one is those huge garbage piles which keep lying in the city well the people in the government will work to remove those it is a big challenge but you cannot run away from your responsibilities all state governments and all municipalities will now have to take concrete actions due to the rising public pressure media is playing a very positive role in this but there is the second aspect which gives me immense pleasure happiness and a sense of satisfaction that the general public has started feeling that leave what happened in the past now they will not dirty their surroundings we will not add to the existing dirt a gentleman mr bharat gupta has sent me a mail on mygov in from satna madhya pradesh he has related his personal experience during his tour of the railways he said that people eat on trains and usually litter around he continues to say that he has been touring from the past many years but it is this time around no one was littering rather they were looking for dustbins to throw their trash when they could not see any arrangements they collected all their litter in a corner he says that it was a very gratifying experience for me i thank bharat ji for sharing this experience with me what i am seeing is that this campaign has had a great influence on kids many families mention that now whenever kids eat a chocolate they themselves pick the wrapper and disposes it i was seeing a message on the social media someone had posted a picture with the title my hero of the day this picture was that of a little kid who picks up trash wherever he goes even when going to school he is himself motivated to do this just see people now feel it is their country and they will not make it dirty we will not add to the existing dirt pile and those do litter feel ashamed for someone is around to point it out to them i consider all these to be good omens another thing is that many people come to meet me who are from all the sections of the society they can be government officers from film world sports world industrialists scientists all of them whenever they interact with me in ten minutes discussion about four to five minutes the discussion is on social issues someone talks about cleanliness while some others talk about education while someone talks about social reforms some people discuss the ruining of family life i initially thought if a businessman comes he will definitely talk of things of his personal interest but i am seeing a major change they talk less about their interest and more about taking on some or the other social responsibility when i add up all these small incidents i see a larger picture and i realize that we are moving in the right direction it is true that unhealthy environment leads to diseases and sickness but where does sickness strike first it first strikes the poor household when we work towards cleanliness we make a major effort in the direction of helping the poor if the poor families are saved from diseases then they will be saved from a lot of financial problems if a person is healthy then he will work hard earn for the family and help in running the family smoothly and so this cleanliness drive is directly related to the health and welfare of my poor brethren we may not be able to do something to help the poor but even keeping the environs clean helps the poor in a big way let us view it from this perspective it will be very beneficial i receive different kinds of letters last time i had mentioned about our specially abled children whom god has given some kind of deficiencies i had expressed my feelings regarding those people i see that people who work in this field are sending me their success stories but i came to know about two things from my people in the government the people from the hrd ministry after hearing my talk felt the need to do something and the officers came together to work out an action plan this is an example of how changes are coming about in governance one they have decided that those specially abled who want to pursue technical education a thousand of them who are good will be selected for special scholarships and a plan has been made i congratulate the officials who could think in those lines another important decision is that all the kendriya vidyalaya s and all central universities will have a special infrastructure for the specially abled for example if they can t climb stairs then there will be provision for ramps to facilitate movement by wheel chair they need different kinds of toilets the hrd ministry has decided to allocate an additional lakh rupees to the kendriya vidyalays and central universities this fund will be used by these institutions to create infrastructure for the specially abled this is an auspicious beginning these things will lead us to change i had the chance to visit siachin a few days back i spent diwali with the jawans who are ready to lay down their lives for the nation when the nation was celebrating diwali i was at siachin it is because of them that we were able to celebrate diwali so i wanted to be with them i experienced the difficulties in which they spent their time there i salute all my jawans but i want to share another matter of great pride with you our jawans work in the field of security in calamities they risk their lives to save our life they also fetch medals for us in sporting events you will be glad to know that these jawans have won a gold medal in a very prestigious event in britain called cambrian patrol defeating contestants from 140 nations i offer these jawans my heartiest congratulations i also got an opportunity to meet the young and dynamic students boys and girls over tea who had won medals in sports they give me renewed energy i was seeing their zeal and enthusiasm the facilities in our country are quite less as compared to other nations but instead of complaining they were just sharing their joy and excitement for me this tea programme for these players was very inspiring and i felt really good i would like to tell you something more and that too from my heart i truly believe that people of my country trust my words and my intentions but today one more time i want to reiterate my commitment as far as black money is concerned my people please trust your prime servant for me this is the article of faith this is my commitment that the hard earned money of the poor people stashed abroad every penny of that should be brought back the ways and means to be followed can be different and this is very obvious in a democratic country but on the basis of as much i understand and as much i know i assure you that we are on the right track today nobody neither me nor the government nor you nor even the previous government knew how much money is stashed abroad everyone gives estimate calculated in his her own way i don t want to get lost in some such figures and estimates its my commitment that be it 2 rupees or 5 rupees or millions or even billions this is the hard earned money of the poor people of my country and it has to come back and i assure you that i will keep trying till the end no efforts will be spared i want your blessings to be always with me i assure you that i will do whatever and whenever something is required to be done for you i give my commitment to you i have received a letter it has been sent by sri abhishek pareekh the same sentiments were expressed to me by many mothers and sisters when i was not even the prime minister some doctor friends had also expressed their concern and i too have expressed my views on this issue a number of times in the past mr parikh has drawn my attention towards the increase of drug addiction that is fast catching up with our young generation he has asked me to discuss this topic in mann ki baat i agree with his concern and i will definitely include this topic in my next edition of mann ki baat i will discuss the topic of drugs drug addiction and drug mafia and how they are a threat to our country s youth if you have some experience any information in this regard if you have ever rescued any child from this drug addiction if you know of any ways and means to help if any government official has played a good role if you give me any such information i will convey such efforts to the public and together we will try to create an environment in each family that no child ever thinks of choosing this vice out of sheer frustration i will definitely discuss this in detail in the next edition i know i am choosing those topics which put the government in the dock but how long will we keep these things hiding how long will we brush these important concerns under the carpet some day or the other we need to take a call follow our instincts and for grand intentions tough calls are equally important i am mustering the courage to do so because your love inspires me to do so and i will continue to do such things because of your love some people told me modi ji you asked us to send you suggestions on facebook twitter or email but a large section of the social class does not have access to these facilities so what can they do your point is very valid everyone does not have this facility well then if you have something to say related to mann ki baat that you hear on the radio even in the villages then do write into me on the following address mann ki baat akashvani sansad marg new delhi even if you send some suggestions through letters they will definitely reach me and i will take them seriously as active citizens are the biggest asset for development you write one letter it indicates that you are very active when you give your opinion it means that you are concerned with national issues and this is strength of the nation i welcome you for my mann ki baat your mann ki baat sould also reach me maybe you will definitely write a letter i will try and interact with you again next month i will try that whenever i talk it is sunday around 11 am so i am getting closer to you the weather is changing winters are slowly setting in this is a good month for health some find it a good season for eating some find it good for wearing nice clothes besides food and clothes it is a good season for health don t let it go waste make the most of it thank you the original speech was in hindi this is the english rendering original speech remains the authoritative version ,i am with you again almost after a month and i want to convey my warm wishes to you all last time we had some general conversation but then i came to some new realizations after that conversation sometimes we think leave it nothing is going to change people are indifferent they will not do anything our country is like this from my last conversation in mann ki baat to this one i would urge you all to change this mindset neither is our country like this nor our people indifferent i salute all my fellow indians cleanliness can anyone imagine that cleanliness will become a such a huge public movement the expectations are high and they should be so i can see some good results
03-Oct-14,"The author expresses his greetings on the occasion of Vijay Dashami and suggests eliminating ten bad habits from within the country. He also mentions the Swachh Bharat movement and urges people to nominate nine people to clean the nation and nominate nine more to do the same. He suggests using Khaadi products to help poor people light lamps on Diwali and offers a special discount for a month. The author emphasizes the importance of identifying one's potential and strengths to progress in life. He reminds readers of a saying by Swami Vivekananda where a flock of sheep used to come and go in different ways. Once, one sheep was left behind and started running towards other sheep, which shocked the other sheep. The text ends with the author expressing gratitude to Ganesh Venkatadari for his recommendation and encouraging others to follow suit.",03-oct-2014 my dear countrymen today is the holy festival of vijay dashami my heartiest greetings on this occasion of vijay dashami to one and all through the medium of radio i would like to share few heartfelt thoughts with you today and i hope that not only today this series of conversation may be carried out regularly in future i will try my best if possible to take out time twice a month or even once to speak with you in future i have also decided that whenever i will speak to you it would be on sundays and time would be morning 11 in that way it would be convenient for you too and i will feel contented with the fact that i am successful in sharing my thoughts with you we are celebrating the festival of vijay dashami today which symbolises the triumph of good over evil but one gentleman named ganesh venkatadari a native of mumbai sent me a mail and has written to me that we must take a vow to eliminate ten bad habits from within ourselves on this occasion of vijay dashami i express my gratitude to him for this recommendation we all as individuals must be thinking to put an end to all our bad habits and win over them although with respect to our nation i believe we all should come together and take a vow in eliminating all the dirt from our country on this occasion of vijay dashami we must take a vow to eliminate dirt and filth and we can do so on this occasion yesterday on 2nd october on the eve of mahatma gandhi s birth anniversary more than 1 25 crore countrymen have started the swachh bharat movement i had shared one thought yesterday which is that i will nominate nine people and they need to upload their videos of cleaning the nation on social media websites and nominating nine more people to do the same i want you all to join me clean the nation and nominate nine more people to clean the nation and those nine people must do the same eventually the entire nation will have this atmosphere i strongly believe that you all will join hands with me to carry this movement forward whenever we think of mahatma gandhi naturally we are reminded of khaadi you may be wearing variety of clothes with different fabrics and company brands in your family but is it not possible to include khaadi too i am not telling you to use only khaadi products i am just insisting to use at least one khaadi product like handkerchief or a bath towel a bed sheet a pillow cover a curtain or anything of that kind if you have an inclination for all kinds of fabrics and clothes in your family you can also buy khaadi products on a regular basis i am saying this as when you buy khaadi products it helps poor people to light lamps on diwali also you can avail a special discount on khaadi products from 2nd october for a month it is a very small thing but has very big impact which binds you with the poor how you see this as a success when i speak of 1 25 crore countrymen and infer the outcome we might assume that government will take care of everything and as individuals we stand nowhere we have seen that if we intend to progress then we need to identify our potential understand our strengths and i can swear that we form the incomparable souls of this world you all know that our own scientists have been successful in reaching mars bearing least expenses we do not lack in our strengths but have forgotten our strong points we have forgotten ourselves we have become hopeless my dear brothers and sisters i cannot let this happen i always remember one of the sayings by swami vivekananda ji as he always used to emphasize on one thought and possibly he might have shared this thought with many others vivekananda ii used to say once a lioness was carrying her two cubs on the way and came upon a flock of sheep from a distance she got a desire to prey upon them and started running towards the flock seeing her running one of the cub too joined her the other cub was left behind and the lioness moved on post preying upon the flock one of the cub went with the lioness but the other cub was left behind and was brought up by a mother sheep he grew among the sheep started speaking their language and adapted their ways of life he used to sit laugh and enjoy with them the cub who went with the lioness was a grown up now once he happened to meet his brother and was shocked to see him he thought in his mind he is a lion and is playing with sheep talking like sheep what is wrong with him he felt that his ego was at stake and went to talk to his brother he said what are you doing brother you are a lion he gets a reply from his brother no i am a sheep i grew up with them they have brought me up listen to my voice and the way i talk he said come i will show you who you really are he took his brother to a well and told him to look in the water his own reflection and asked him if both of them had similar faces i am a lion you too are a lion his brother s self esteem got awakened he attained self realization through this and even a lion brought up among sheep started roaring like a lion his inner entity was awakened swami vivekananda ji used to say the same my countrymen 125 crore indians have indefinite strengths and capabilities we need to understand ourselves we need to identify our inner strengths and like swami ji always used to say we need to carry our self respect identify ourselves and move forward in life and be successful which in turn make our nation a winning and successful country i believe all our countrymen with a population of 125 crores are efficient strong and can stand against any odds with confidence these days i have been getting many letters through social media websites like facebook from my friends one of them mr gautam pal has addressed an issue regarding the specially abled children he has suggested forming separate municipality municipal corporation or councils for them we need to plan something for them for enhancing their moral support i liked his suggestion and i have experienced this during my day as chief minister of gujarat a special olympics was held in athens in 2011 after the olympics i had called all the participants and winners of specially abled category from gujarat to my home i spent two hours with them and it was the most emotional and inspiring incident of my life as i believe a specially abled child is not only the responsibility of the parents in a family it is the responsibility of the entire society god has chosen this family to support a specially abled child but a child is a responsibility of the entire nation after this incident i got so emotionally attached with them i started organizing separate olympics for them in gujarat thousands of children with their parents used to come and attend i too used to attend the olympics there was an atmosphere of trust and this is the reason i liked the suggestion given by mr gautam pal and i felt like sharing this thought with you it reminds me of another story once a traveller was sitting at the corner of a road and was asking everyone the way to a specific place he continued asking the route from many people a man sitting beside him was observing him the traveller stood up and started asking passers by again he stood up and said the way to your destination is here the traveller then said brother you were sitting next to me for so long saw me asking everyone the route if you knew the route why didn t you tell me before the man answered i was waiting to verify if you really intend to reach your destination or you are asking people just for your knowledge but when you stood up i was assured that you truly wish to reach your destination and decided to confirm the address my countrymen till the time we do not decide to walk stand on our own we will also not the get the guidance from others in our journey we will not get the people to hold our hand and help us in walking we need to take the initiative in walking and i trust all my 125 crore indians who are capable of walking on their own and will keep moving for the past few days i have been getting very interesting suggestions from people i am aware when to adapt to these suggestions but i want everyone to actively participate in these suggestions as we all belong to our nation the nation does not only belong to any government we are the citizens of our nation and we all need to unite without any exceptions some of you have suggested simplifying the registration process for small scale industries i will definitely put this under government s notice some of you have written to me to incorporate skills development courses in the school curriculum from 5th standard this will help the students to learn various skills and crafts i loved this effective suggestion given by them they have also suggested that even the adults should learn skills development courses along with their studies one of the suggestions given was to keep a dustbin at every 100 meters and a cleaning system should be established some of you have written to me to abolish the use of plastic bags i am receiving numerous suggestions from people i have always been telling you to write to me and narrate a true incident which is positive and inspiring to me and our countrymen along with the evidence if you do this i can promise this to you that i will share all those heartfelt thoughts or suggestions with all our countrymen through mann ki baat i have only one intention in speaking with you all come let us serve our mother india let us all take our nation to the new heights let us all take a step forward if you take one step our nation takes 125 crore steps to move forward and for this purpose on this auspicious occasion of vijay dashami we all need to defeat all of our inner evils and decide to start doing something good for the nation today is the fortunate beginning for me i will be sharing my heartfelt thoughts with one and all today i have shared all the thoughts coming directly from my heart i will meet you all next at 11 am on sundays but i trust our journey shall never end and will continue receiving love and suggestions from you after listening to my thoughts please do not hesitate in sharing your thoughts or advice to me i will appreciate that your suggestions keep coming i am glad to talk with you through this simple medium of radio which serves each and every corner of the nation i can reach the poorest homes as mine my nation s strength lies within the hut of poor within the villages my nation s strength lies with the mothers sisters and youths my nation s strength lies with the farmers nation will only progress if you believe in it i am expressing my trust towards the nation i believe in your strength hence i believe in our nation s future i would once again like to thank one and all for taking out time and listening to me thank you all the original speech was in hindi this is the english rendering original speech remains the authoritative version ,my dear countrymen today is the holy festival of vijay dashami my heartiest greetings to one and all through the medium of radio i would like to share few heartfelt thoughts with you today and i hope that not only today this series of conversation may be carried out regularly in future i have also decided that whenever i will speak to you it would be on sundays and time would be morning 11
14-Dec-14,"The content is a transcript of a speech given by a Prime Minister who is sharing his views on various topics. He talks about the importance of parents spending time with their children and discussing their spiritual progress, not just their material progress. He also discusses the issue of drug addiction and the need for everyone to work together to prevent it. The Prime Minister emphasizes the importance of having an ambition in life and staying focused on it. He also shares his joy in meeting the Blind Cricket Team, who won the world cup, and their determination and passion. Overall, the speech is about sharing concerns and joys and working together to create a responsible environment.",14-dec-2014 my dear fellow countrymen today i have this great opportunity of interacting with you again you must be wondering why a prime minister should be interacting the way i am doing it well first and foremost i am a less of your prime minister and more of a pradhan sewak serving the people since childhood i have been hearing that by sharing our intensity of pain become less while the intensity of our joys grow manifold well i think this is the guiding thought behind mann ki baat it is an opportunity for me to sometimes share my concern and sometimes my joy sharing my deepest concerns with you makes me feel light hearted and sharing my joy just doubles my happiness last time i mentioned my concern about the youth of the country it is not because you chose me as the prime minister but because i feel concerned as an individual sons and daughters of many families are caught in the trap of drugs it just does not destroy the person involved but his entire family the society and the nation at large drug is such a grave menace which destroys the most powerful individuals while serving as the chief minister of gujarat my officers with good records would often come to ask for leave initially they would hesitate to spell out the reasons however on insisting they revealed that their child had fallen into the drug trap and they now need to spend time with their kids and rehabilitate them i could see the bravest of my officers struggling to control their tears i met suffering mothers too in punjab i had the chance to meet some mothers who were very angry and yet concerned about their children who had fallen into the trap of drugs we have to work together as a society to tackle this menace i understand that the youth who fall into this drug trap are often blamed we blame these youth as being careless and irresponsible we perceive that the victims are bad but the fact is that the drugs are bad the youth are not wrong it is this addiction which is wrong let us not blame and wrong our kids let us get rid of this habit of addiction and not victimize our kids blaming the kids would push them further into addiction this is in fact a psycho socio medical issue and let us treat it as such a problem this menace needs to be handled carefully as its solution is not limited to medical intervention only the individual concerned his family friends the society the government and the legal system all have to work in tandem to tackle this menace each one of us have to contribute to get rid of this menace a few days ago i had organized a dgp level conference in assam i expressed my concern over this issue and my displeasure at the non serious attitude of the people concerned i have asked the police department to seriously discuss this issue and come out with relevant solutions i have suggested the department to launch a toll free helpline the families often feel ashamed to come out in open about the addiction problem of their children they have no one to confide in parents from any part any corner of the country can freely approach the police if their children have fallen a victim to addiction the department has taken this suggestion seriously and working towards its fulfillment the drug menace brings about the three d s these three d s are not the ones related to entertainment but i am talking about the three d s related to the three vices first d is darkness the second d is destruction and the third d is devastation drugs lead a person to a blind path of destruction there is nothing left in its trail but devastation this is a topic of great concern and demands total attention i had mentioned this topic in my last address in mann ki baat we received more than 7000 letters on our akashvani address some letters were received in the government offices we received responses on government portal mygov in online and through e mails lakhs of comments were received on twitter and facebook hence a deep rooted concern in the society s psyche has found a voice i am especially thankful to the media of our country for carrying this concern forward many channels conducted hour long programs these programs were not just meant to criticize the government they were forums for open discussion a concern and an effort to come out with workable solutions these initiatives created background for healthy discussions the government was also sensitized to its responsibilities in this direction the government can no longer remain neutral to these concerns there is a question i want to ask these youth caught in the drug trap i want to ask these youth that when for three or four hours they are in a state of intoxication they might be feeling free of all concerns free of all tensions and in a different world altogether but have you ever lent a thought to the fact that when you buy drugs where does this money go to have you ever thought about it just make a guess what if this drug money goes to the terrorists what if this money is spent by the terrorists to procure weapons and with this weapon the very same terrorist might be pumping bullets in the heart of my soldiers the soldier of my country gets martyred have you ever thought about our soldiers a soldier who is so dear to his mother the treasured son of mother india the brave son of the soil is hit by a bullet probably funded by the money spent on purchasing drugs i know and firmly believe that you too love your motherland and have tremendous respect for our soldiers then how can you support a habit which funds drug mafia and the terrorists some people feel that when a person is in despair faces failures and when he is directionless he is an easy prey to drugs but i feel that people who lack ambition do not have any set goals and targets who have a deep vacuum in their lives are the ones where drugs will have an easy access if you want to avoid drugs and save your children from this menace then foster ambition in them give them dreams to pursue and make them individuals with a desire to achieve something in life then you will see that they will not be easily distracted their aim then will be to achieve something in life have you ever followed a sportsman s life a sportsman is motivated forever in the bleak winters everyone feels like sleeping in the warmth of a quilt but a sportsman will still rise at 4 or 5 and go for his workouts why because the goal is set similarly if your child would be aimless there are chances of him her to fall prey to menace like drugs i remember the words of vivekananda these words are very apt for all the young people just keep repeating this thought over and over again take a thought make it your life ponder on it and dream about it make it an integral part of your dreams make it a part of your mind brain veins and each and every part of your body and forget everything else this thought of vivekananda is apt for every young person and that is why i say that each person should have an ambition in life having an ambition does not allow your focus on unnecessary things some take it under peer pressure because it looks cool some consider it as a style statement so sometimes the youth inadvertently fall into this serious trap due to the wrong mental perception addiction is neither cool nor a style statement in reality it is a precursor to destruction so whenever your friends boast about their drug habits do not applaud and enjoy such conversation do not be a mute spectator to such absurdities have the courage to stand against such conversations and say no have the guts to despise such a conversation reject such a conversation and have the guts to tell the person that he is wrong i would like to share some views with the parents too these days none of us have time all of us are running against time to earn our livelihood we are racing against time to improve the quality of our lives but in this blind race do we have the time to spare for our kids do we ever work for our kid s spiritual progress and discuss it with them rather we discuss only material progress how are they doing in their studies what has been their progress in exam what to eat and what not to eat where to go and where not to go majorly these topics form the core of the entire interactions do we share such a relationship that our children can bare their hearts to us i request all of you to do this if your children share a frank relationship then you can very well know what is going on in their life children do not take to bad habits suddenly it happens gradually and it also impacts the home observe the changes that are happening in your home if you observe closely then i believe that you may be successful in detecting the problem at the very beginning be aware of your child s friend circle and don t keep your conversations focused just about progress your concern should extend to their inner depths their thoughts their logic their books their friends and their mobiles how and where are they spending their time these need to be taken care of i believe that no one else can do what a parent can for their kids our ancestors have left us certain pearls of wisdom and that is why they are known as statesmen a saying goes like this paanch varsh laaw lijiye dass laaw tadan dei paanch varsh laaw lijiye dass laaw tadan dei sut hi solah varsh mein mitra sarij gani dei this means that till 5 years of age a child should grow in the loving and tender care of his parents by the time he is 10 the values of discipline should be inculcated in him sometimes we see that an intelligent mother gets angry and does not speak with her child throughout the day this is a big punishment for the child the mother punishes herself but the child too gets punished in turn the mother just has to say that i will not talk and the 10 year old will remain worried the whole day long he changes his habit and by the time he is of 16 years then the relationship should turn like a friend towards him there should be an open conversation with him this is a brilliant advice which has been passed on by our ancestors i would like to see this inculcated in our family life another thing brought to our notice is the role of the pharmacists some of the medicines lead to addiction so such medicines should not be distributed without a doctor s prescription sometimes a simple thing like a cough syrup can trigger addiction it becomes the starting point for addiction there are quite a few things that i would not like to raise from this platform but we will have to follow and accept this discipline these days many children from villages go to city for higher education and start living in a hostel or a boarding school i have heard that sometimes these avenues become the entry point of such addiction for this the education system the society and the security force will have to act as a vigilante each one will have to fulfill their roles and responsibilities the government will fulfill the responsibilities on its end we should constantly strive to fulfill our obligations i would also like to mention about the letters we have received some of them are interesting some are filled with grief and some are inspiring i cannot mention all but i would like to mention one there was a certain mr dutt he was deep into addiction he was also jailed where he had several restrictions then later his life changed he studied in jail and then his life was transformed his story is very famous he was in yerawada jail there might be many such inspiring stories many people have been victorious in their fight against addiction we too can come out of such habits and so we should definitely try we should make efforts for de addiction and rehabilitation i would ask celebrities to be a part of this initiative be it from the field of cinema sports or someone concerned with public life be it the cultural or spiritual world we should use every possible platform to create awareness there should be constant messages in public interest they will certainly have an effect those active on the social media i would request them to create a continuous online movement by joining drugsfreeindia hash tag this is more relevant because most of the addicted youth are a part of the social media if we take this drugsfreeindia hash tag movement forward then we will do a great service for public awareness and education i want to take this concern forward i would request all those who have successfully come out of this addiction to share their stories i touched this topic because like i said in the beginning grief becomes less on sharing this is a topic of national concern and i am not here to sermonize and neither am i entitled to preach i am just sharing my grief with you those families who are suffering from this menace i want to share their pain as well i want to create a responsible environment there can be difference of opinions but let us make a beginning somewhere like i mentioned before i want to share happiness last week i had the opportunity to meet the blind cricket team they had won the world cup what joy and excitement they were exuding great self confidence god has given us everything eyes hands legs i e we are totally capable yet we lack this kind of determination and passion which i could see in the blind cricketers what zeal and enthusiasm really it was contagious i felt super charged after meeting them such incidents bring great pleasure in life in the past few days there was yet another important news the cricket team from kashmir defeated mumbai on their home ground i do not view it as a matter of someone s victory and other s loss i view it differently all the stadiums in kashmir have been inundated after the floods kashmir is passing through a tough phase the circumstances have been extremely grim with these boys not standing any chance to practice but the team spirit shown by these boys their conviction and determination is awe inspiring these boys have shown us that one can overcome the most trying and testing circumstances if one remains focused on our goals this news gave me immense pleasure and i take this opportunity to congratulate all these players on their victory two days back the united nations has decided to celebrate june 21st as international yoga day it is a matter of great pride and honour for india our ancestors developed a beautiful tradition and today the entire world is associated with it it does not merely benefit one personally but it has the potential to bring all the people together globally the entire world came together on the issue of yoga in the un and a unanimous resolution was passed just two days back 177 countries became the co sponsors in the past when it was decided to celebrate the birthday mr nelson mandela 165 countries became co sponsors before that efforts were on for international toilet day and 122 nations became co sponsors to that initiative too for celebrating oct 2nd as non violence day 140 countries became co sponsors

to observe world yoga day it is now our duty that yoga reaches out to the masses in its true essence last week i had the chance to have a meeting with the chief ministers of all the states this tradition has been going on for the past 50 60 years this time it was organized at the prime minister s residence we started it as a retreat program with no papers no files and no officers it was a simple interaction where the prime minister and chief minister were all the same seated together like friends for an hour or two matters of national concern were seriously discussed in a friendly atmosphere everyone just poured their hearts out there was no political agenda involved this too was a memorable experience that i wanted to share with you last week i had the chance to travel to the north east i had been there for three days many a times youth express their desire to see the taj singapore or dubai but i would urge all the nature lovers all who want to experience the divinity in nature to take a tour of the north east i had gone earlier too this time when i went as the prime minister i tried to explore its potential our north east has tremendous potential and possibilities it s a land of beautiful people and beautiful surroundings i was filled with immense joy visiting that place sometimes people ask modi ji don t you get tired i want to say that whatever little fatigue i had well the north east took it away completely i am thoroughly rejuvenated such is the pleasure that i derived from that visit the love and respect accorded by the people there is something that will stay with me forever the kinship and affinity showed by the people of the north east touched me deeply i will also tell you it is not a joy for only modi to enjoy it is there for you to enjoy too so

last sunday of every month but this time it is being held a week earlier all of you know i ll be in america next week and there the schedule is going to be pretty hectic and hence i thought i d talk to you before i go what could be better than that the blessings of the janata janardan the people your inspiration will also continue to enhance my energy friends many people say that as prime minister i did a certain good work or some other great work many listeners of mann ki baat shower praises in their letters some say a particular task was performed others refer to a job well done some express that a certain work was much better in fact very good at that but when i see the efforts of the common man of india the sheer hard work the will power i myself am moved be it the loftiest goal be it the toughest challenge the collective might of the people of india the collective power provides a solution to every challenge just two three days ago we saw how big a cyclone hit the western part of the country strong winds heavy rain cyclone biparjoy caused a lot of destruction in kutch but the courage and preparedness with which the people of kutch fought such a dangerous cyclone is equally unprecedented too just a couple of days later the people of kutch are also going to celebrate their new year that is ashadhi beej it is also a coincidence that ashadhi beej is considered a symbol of the onset of rains in kutch i have been going to kutch for many years i have also had the good fortune to serve the people there and thats how i know very well the zest and fortitude of the people of kutch kutch was once termed as never to be able to recover after the devastating earthquake two decades ago today the same district is one of the fastest growing districts of the country i am sure the people of kutch will rapidly emerge from the devastation caused by cyclone biperjoy friends no one has any control over natural calamities but the strength of disaster management that india has developed over the years is becoming an example today there is a significant way to combat natural calamities viz conservation of nature these days during monsoon our responsibility in this direction increases manifold that is why today the country is making collective efforts through campaigns like catch the rain last month in mann ki baat we had discussed about start ups associated with water conservation this time too i have come to know through letters about many people who are trying their very best to save every drop of water one such friend is tulsiram yadav ji of banda district of up tulsiram yadav ji is the pradhan of luktara gram panchayat you too know that there have always been hardships regarding water in banda and bundelkhand regions to overcome this challenge tulsiram ji has built more than 40 ponds in the area taking the people of the village along with him tulsiram ji has made the basis of his campaign farm water in farms village water in villages today the result of his hard work is that the ground water level in his village is improving similarly in hapur district in u p people collectively have revived an extinct river a long time ago there used to be a river here named neem as time went by she disappeared but was always remembered in local memories and folklore eventually people decided to revive this natural heritage of theirs on account of the collective efforts of the people the neem river has started flowing again the point of origin of the river the headwater is also being developed as an amrit sarovar friends these rivers canals lakes are not only water sources life s myriad hues emotions are also associated with them a similar scene was observed in maharashtra just a few days ago this particular area mostly remains in the grip of drought after waiting for five decades the canal work of nilwande dam is now being completed here a few days ago water was released in the canal during testing the pictures that came up during this time were really emotional the people of the village were rejoicing as if it were the holi diwali festival friends when it comes to management i will also remember chhatrapati shivaji maharaj today along with the bravery of chhatrapati shivaji maharaj there is a lot to learn from his governance and management skills in particular the work done by chhatrapati shivaji maharaj regarding water management and navy they raise the glory of indian history even today the sea forts built by him still stand proudly in the middle of the sea even after so many centuries the beginning of this month itself marks the completion of 350 years of the coronation of chhatrapati shivaji maharaj this occasion is being celebrated as a big festival during this grand programs related to it were organized in raigad fort in maharashtra i remember many years ago in 2014 i had the good fortune to go to raigad and pay obeisance to that holy land it is the duty of all of us to know about the management skills of chhatrapati shivaji maharaj on this occasion learn from him this will instill in us a sense of pride in our heritage and will also inspire us to perform our duties in the future my dear countrymen you must have heard about the tiny squirrel from the ramayana who came forward to help build the ram setu what i mean to say is that when the intention is noble there is honesty in the efforts no goal remains insurmountable today india too with a noble intention is facing a huge challenge the challenge is t b or tuberculosis india has resolved to create a t b free india by 2025 the goal is certainly a lofty one there was a time when after coming to know about t b family members used to turn away but today t b patients are being helped by making them family members to eliminate tuberculosis from the root nikshay mitras have taken the lead a large number of varied social organizations have become nikshay mitra in the country thousands of people in villages panchayats have come forward themselves and adopted t b patients there are many children who have come forward to help tb patients this public participation is the biggest strength of this campaign it is due to this participation that today more than 10 lakh tb patients in the country have been adopted and this is a noble deed on the part of close to 85 thousand nikshay mitras i am happy that many sarpanchs of the country even the village heads have taken this initiative that they will spare no effort to uproot tb from their villages shriman dikar singh mewari a nikshay friend of a village in nainital has adopted six tb patients similarly shriman gyan singh head of a village panchayat of kinnaur and a nikshay mitra also is engaged in providing every necessary help to tb patients in his block our children and young friends are also not far behind in the campaign to make india tb free look at the wonder of nalini singh a 7 year old daughter from una himachal pradesh daughter nalini is helping t b patients through her pocket money you know how much kids love piggy banks but 13 year old meenakshi from katni district of mp and 11 year old bashwar mukherjee from diamond harbor in west bengal are both different kids both these children have also handed over their piggy bank money to the t b free india campaign all these examples apart from evoking emotions are also very inspiring i heartily appreciate all these children who are thinking big at a tender age my dear countrymen it is the nature of us indians to be always ready to welcome new ideas we love our things and also imbibe new things an example of this is japan s technique miyawaki if the soil at some place has not been fertile then the miyawaki technique is a very good way to make that area green again miyawaki forests spread rapidly and become biodiversity spots in two to three decades this is now spreading very fast in different parts of india too shriman raafi ramnath a teacher from kerala changed the scenario of the area with this technique actually ramnath ji wanted to explain deeply about nature and environment to his students for this he went to the extent of creating a herbal garden his garden has now become a biodiversity zone this success of his inspired him even more after this raafi ji grew a mini forest with the miyawaki technique and named it vidyavanam now only a teacher can come up with such a beautiful name vidyavanam in the tiny space in this vidyavanam of ramnathji over 450 trees of 115 varieties were planted his students also help him in their maintenance school children from the neighbourhood common citizens throng in hordes to view this beautiful place miyawaki forests can be easily grown anywhere even in cities some time ago i had inaugurated a miyawaki forest in kevadia ekta nagar in gujarat in kutch too in the memory of the people who died in the 2001 earthquake a smriti van has been built in the miyawaki style its success in a place like kutch shows how effective this technology is even in the toughest of natural environments similarly saplings have been planted in ambaji and pavagadh by the miyawaki method i have come to know that a miyawaki garden is also being created in aliganj lucknow in the last four years work has been done on more than 60 such forests in mumbai and its surrounding areas now this technique is being appreciated all over the world it is being used extensively in many countries like singapore paris australia malaysia i would urge the countrymen especially those living in cities to make an effort to learn about the miyawaki method through this you can make invaluable contribution in making our earth and nature green and clean my dear countrymen nowadays there is a lot of discussion about jammu and kashmir in our country sometimes due to rising tourism at times due to the spectacular events of g 20 some time ago i had told you in mann ki baat how nadru of kashmir are being relished outside the country as well now the people of baramulla district of jammu and kashmir have done a wonderful job farming has been going on in baramulla for a long time but here there was a shortage of milk the people of baramulla took this challenge as an opportunity a large number of people started dairy farming here the women here came to the forefront of this task such as a sister ishrat nabi ishrat a graduate has started mir sisters dairy farm about 150 litres of milk is being sold every day from their dairy farm similarly one such friend is from sopore wasim anayat wasim has more than two dozen animals and he sells more than two hundred liters of milk every day another youth abid hussain is also doing dairy farming his work is also progressing a lot due to the hard work of such people 5 5 lakh liters of milk is being produced daily in baramulla the entire baramulla is turning into the symbol of a new white revolution during the last two and a half three years more than 500 dairy units have come up here the dairy industry of baramulla is a testimony to the fact that every part of our country is full of possibilities the collective will of the people of a region can achieve any goal my dear countrymen this

international events but often there was no mention of india in them but today i am just mentioning the successes of the past few weeks even then the list becomes so long this is the real strength of our youth there are many such sports and competitions where today for the first time india is making her presence felt for example in long jump shrishankar murali has won a bronze for the country in a prestigious event like the paris diamond league this is india s first medal in this competition one such similar success has been registered by our under seventeen women wrestling team in kyrgyzstan i congratulate all these athletes of the country their parents and coaches for their efforts friends behind this success of the country in international events is the hard work of our sportspersons at

university and karnataka s jain university have occupied the first three places in the medal tally friends a major aspect of such tournaments is that many inspiring stories of young players come to

democratic ideals as paramount we consider our constitution as supreme therefore we can never forget june the 25th this is the very day when emergency was imposed on our country it was a dark period in the history of india lakhs of people opposed the emergency with full might the supporters of democracy were tortured so much during that time that even today it makes the mind tremble many books have been written on these atrocities the punishment meted out by the police and administration i had also got the opportunity to write a book named sangharsh mein gujarat at that time a few days ago i came across another book written on the emergency torture of political prisoners in india this book published during the emergency describes how at that time the government was treating the guardians of democracy most cruelly there are many case studies in this book there are many pictures i wish that today when we are celebrating the azadi ka amrit mahotsav we must also have a glance at such crimes which endanger the freedom of the country this will make it easier for today s young generation to understand the meaning and significance of democracy my dear countrymen mann ki baat is a

PM Modi encouraged continued participation, emphasizing the government's commitment to working on citizens' suggestions for the betterment of the nation.",20-sep-2015 my dear countrymen greetings to you all this is the twelfth episode of mann ki baat and in a way it means that we have completed one year last year on 3rd october i had an opportunity to conduct my first ever mann ki baat mann ki baat one year many thoughts i am not sure of what you gained but i can certainly say that i gained a lot in a democracy the power of the people is of great significance this thought has been fundamental to my thinking and that is why i have immense faith in the power of the people but with mann ki baat whatever i was taught whatever i was explained and the experiences i had made me realize that the power of the people is limitless and it far exceeds our thinking our ancestors would say that there is a divine element in each individual my experience of mann ki baat made me realize that the thinking of our ancestors was very powerful and had great authenticity in them as i have myself experienced them i asked for suggestions for mann ki baat and yet could touch upon just 3 4 of them but people continued to contribute actively in lakhs this in itself is a great power i did not feel that anyone got disheartened thinking that i wrote a letter to the pm or posted on mygov in yet my suggestions were not accepted even once yes these lakhs of letters did teach me something more i became aware of very minute problems associated with governance i would like to congratulate akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people they conducted programmes after that they called in various departments and put across them the issues that the people had raised they tried to get certain problems resolved the various departments of the government analyzed these letters and segregated them as the ones related to policy matters others to personal issues some others as pointers that the government was not even aware of many things arose from the grass root level and reached the government it is true the basic principle of governance is that information should percolate upwards from bottom and guidance should percolate from the top to the bottom who would have thought that the mann ki baat will become a source of information but this has happened in the same way mann ki baat became a platform to express the power of society i had just casually mentioned about selfie with daughter and what a movement it became the whole world was amazed lakhs of people perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters what dignity did it lend to our daughters anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughter s confidence but also made a commitment to them whosoever saw it realized that they will now have to give up the indifferent attitude towards daughters this was a kind of a silent revolution i had casually mentioned to my fellow citizens keeping in mind the tourism industry of india to send me good pictures of the destination they travel to on the lines of incredible india so that i can also see them people sent pictures in lakhs from every corner of india neither the government of india nor the state tourism departments were aware of such heritage all things were brought together on a platform and the government did not have to spend a single penny the people themselves took the task forward in october last year i did my first mann ki baat in that edition i had mentioned about gandhi jayanti i told people that we are celebrating gandhiji s birth anniversary on 2nd october there was a time when there was khadi for nation isn t it the need of the hour that there be khadi for fashion i requested the people to buy khadi and to do their bit today i can say with great satisfaction that in the past one year the sales of khadi have almost doubled now see there was no government advertisement nor were lakhs and crores spent a simple feeling and realization by the people has brought this change once i had mentioned in mann ki baat about the problem of poor families how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit shouldn t they be getting gas cylinders and i had requested the affluent to surrender their gas subsidy just think today i can say with great pride that 30 lakh families have given up their gas subsidy and these are not the rich people i saw on t v a retired teacher a widow lady standing in a queue to give up her subsidy the common people from the society belonging to the middle and lower middle class have difficulty in giving up subsidy but then they did give up their subsidy isn t it a silent revolution isn t it a demonstration of the people s power the governments too will need to learn a lesson that there lies a powerful society which has tremendous capabilities energy and the determination beyond the realms of their administration there is more likelihood of the government being a catalytic agent of change if it is better connected to the society mann ki baat has turned my faith into belief and reverence and once again i would like to salute this immense power of the people through this platform they took up every small cause and made it their own and tried to contribute to the welfare of the country can there be a bigger satisfaction than this this time i thought of conducting a new experiment through mann ki baat i had requested the citizens to call up telephonically and get their suggestions or queries recorded i told them that i will take it up in mann ki baat i am happy that we received more than 55 000 calls from across the country be it siachen kutch or kamrup be it kashmir or kanyakumari there is no part of india from which i did not receive a phone call this is a pleasant experience in itself people of all age groups have sent messages i listened to some message personally and i liked them my team is working on the others you must have spent just a minute or two but for me your phone calls are very important the entire government will work on your suggestions but there was something which surprised me and made me equally happy it feels as if there is negativity all around us but my experience was different these 55 000 people expressed themselves in their own way it was frank interaction where they could say anything but i am surprised that all the things were in the shadow of mann ki baat they were totally positive suggestion oriented and constructive just see how the citizens of the country are moving with a positive attitude this is the nation s greatest wealth there were serious complaints in about 1 2 phone calls but more than 90 things were energizing and pleasant another thing came to my mind for the specially abled and among them especially from the kin of visually impaired they made quite a number of phone calls the reason may be that they are not able to watch t v but they must definitely be listening to the radio this made me realize how important the radio is for the visually impaired people i am seeing a new aspect and they put forth such good suggestions that they are enough to make the governments more sensitive pawan acharya form alwar rajasthan has sent me a message i believe that all of you should hear it and follow it please hear what he wants to say my name is pawan acharya and i belong to alwar rajasthan i want to give the message to prime minister shri narendra modi ji to request all the people of india through his programme mann ki baat to use as much earthen lamps diya as they can this diwali this will not only help the environment but will also provide employment to many potter families thank you pawan i believe that this sentiment will definitely reach every corner of india it is a good suggestion and the soil is priceless so the earthen lamps will be valuable too it is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man s home poor people earn their living this way i request the citizens to follow pawan s advice in the coming festivals if we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor my dear countrymen on the day of ganesh chaturthi i had the privilege of spending 2 3 hours with the jawans of the armed forces the jawans from our army navy and air force guarding our land waters and skies we have completed 50 years of our war with pakistan in 1965 to commemorate this event an exhibition named shouryanjali had been organized near india gate i saw it with immense interest i went there for half an hour but when i came out it was more than 2 5 hours and i felt like seeing more what was it that was not there the entire history has been brought to life from aesthetic perspective it was excellent from historical perspective it was very educative and if we see it from inspirational point of view from the perspective to serve the motherland then there can be no greater inspiration than this at that time there was not much photography or videography but still those proud moments of war those tales of valour and sacrifice of our great soldiers which we had heard can all be experienced here through this exhibition whether it is the battle of haji pir chaminda or asal uttar and the visuals of our victory near haji pir we feel thrilled and immensely proud of our soldiers i had the opportunity to meet the brave families families of those who had sacrificed their lives and also those who had participated in the war who are in the twilight years of their lives they too had come and when i was shaking hands it was filled with great energy was very inspiring if you want to create history then it is necessary to understand the nuances of the past history binds us to our roots if we are detached from our history then the possibilities of creating history comes to an end this exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past it gives us knowledge about our history and this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history this exhibition will last a few days i request you and your relatives living in delhi and nearby areas to definitely visit it and do not be in haste like me i came back in 2 2 5 hours but you will need 3 4 hours do see it look at the power of democracy a young kid has ordered the prime minister although the kid forgot to tell his name in a hurry i do not have his name with me but what he said is worth giving a thought not only should the prime minister think about what he said but every indian citizen should listen to what this child has to say prime minister modi ji i want to tell you that for the swachhta abhiyan cleaniness drive that you started you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner this child is absolutely right we should adopt cleanliness as a habit and should make provisions for cleanliness i got great satisfaction from this child s message on the 2nd of october i declared this cleanliness drive and i think something like this has happened for the first time after independence because even in the parliament cleanliness is being discussed for hours these days our government is criticized as well i even have to listen to a lot of things people say things like modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness but what really happened i don t get offended by all this i look at the positive side of it which is that even the parliament of the country is discussing about the issue of cleanliness in india look at the other side on one hand the parliament and on the other hand this child of the country both are talking about cleanliness a country cannot be more fortunate than this this ongoing movement of thoughts the environment that s building against filth there has been an awareness towards cleanliness this will also compel the governments to work the self governing regional bodies be it panchayats municipal corporations municipalities municipal corporations of metropolitan cities central government or state government everybody will have to work on this we will have to take this movement forward despite its shortcomings and when in india in 2019 when we celebrate the 150th birthday of mahatma gandhi we should aspire to work in the direction of fulfilling his dream do you know what mahatma gandhi used to say he once said if i have to choose between freedom and cleanliness i will choose cleanliness first and freedom later cleanliness was more important for gandhi than freedom come let us all follow what mahatma gandhi said and take a few steps towards fulfilling his wish mr gulshan arora from delhi has left a message on mygov he has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of dindayal ji my dear fellow citizens the lives of great men will always inspire us it is not our responsibility to figure out the ideology of these great men everyone who lives and dies for our nation inspires us in the coming days we will get to remember a lot of these great men 25th september we shall remember pandit deendayal upadhaya mahatma gandhi and lal bahadur shastri on the 2nd of october jai prakash narayan ji on 11th october sardar vallabh bhai patel on 31st october and there are innumerable names i have mentioned just a few because our country has an unending list of such gems you pick any date you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history we must all try to remember these great personalities in the coming days take their message to every house and we should try to learn something from them ourselves i would like to request you for 2nd october specially it s the birth anniversary of honorable bapu mahatma gandhi i had told you last year as well that you all must have all kind of fashionable clothing all kinds of fabric a lot of things but you must also own khadi i am saying it again that khadi begins a discounted sale from 2nd october onwards for one whole month you must all avail this sale along with khadi handloom must also be given equal importance our weavers put in a lot of hard work if we 1 5 billion indians buy a handloom product or khadi for even rs 5 10 or rs 50 then ultimately that money will reach the poor weaver it will reach the poor widow who weaves khadi and this is why we must all spare some place for khadi at our homes and on our bodies this diwali i just have this small request i do not insist that you only wear khadi but have a few collection this is my only request look last year we almost doubled the khadi sale a lot of the poor have been benefitted advertisements worth crores by the government cannot achieve what has been achieved through your help this is the power of the masses and this is why i request you to come forward and help once again dear countrymen my heart is filled with joy because of this one thing i wish to share this joy with you as well i visited kolkata in the month of may and the family members of subhash chandra bose came to meet me his nephew chandra bose had organized everything i got the opportunity to spend quality time with subhash babu s family members that day i decided to invite his great family to the prime minister s residence mr chandra bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week i received the confirmation that around 50 members of the bose family are coming to the prime minister s residence for a meeting you can imagine how happy i must have been on hearing this news netaji s family members probably must have been invited together to the prime minister s residence for the first time more than that i feel honoured to realize that this opportunity that i will get in october must be a one of a kind opportunity for the prime minister s residence to offer its hospitality more than 50 family members of subhash babu s family who stay in different countries are specially coming down to attend this meeting it is going to be a joyous moment for me i am very excited to welcome them and feel extremely happy i received a message from bhargavi kande and after listening to the way she speaks her voice i felt she is a leader herself or she is going to be a leader probably my name is bhargavi kande i want to request the prime minister to make the young generation aware about voter s registration which will increase the participation of the young generation in the times to come and in the future the young generation will provide its important contribution in selecting as well as running a government thank you bhargavi talked about registering the names in the voter s list and the voting process in a democracy every voter determines the destiny of a country and this awareness is spreading gradually the voting percentage is also increasing and for this i want to congratulate the election commission of india up until a few years back we saw that our election commission worked only as a regulator but it has changed a lot in the last few years today our election commission does not work only as a regulator but has become a facilitator has become voter friendly and the voter is at the centre of all its policies and its ideologies it is a great change but we need more than what election commission can do we must mobilize schools colleges and societies we must spread awareness always not only during the time of elections the voter s list must be updated we must also keep a watch on it this priceless right that i have is it safe am i using it or not we must all develop this habit i hope that all the youngsters who have not been registered in the voter s list yet get themselves registered and must vote too i publically say during elections that one must cast his vote before he eats his food this is a holy act everyone must do it i have returned from a visit to kashi day before yesterday i met a lot of people and attended a lot of events i met many people there but these two kids i met have told me something that i want to share with you today one of the boys kshitij is a student of class 7 he studies in the kendriya vidyalaya of banaras hindu university he is a very smart kid with a surprising high confidence level at such a young age i saw that he was interested in research in the field of physics i thought he must be reading a lot books must be surfing internet must be watching new experiments he was talking about things like how to stop railway accidents which technology to use how to save money in producing energy how to develop feelings in robots and what not he was an amazing kid although i could not follow what he was saying very closely but i liked his confidence and his interest in so many things i want that kids in our country should develop more and more interest in science kids should be very inquisitive why how when a kid should always ask these questions similarly i met a small girl named sonam patel she is 9 years old she is the daughter of sadavrat patel a resident of sundarpur varanasi her family is very poor i was surprised that the girl had memorized the bhagvada geeta completely but the most interesting thing was that she kept reciting the shlokas along with its english interpretation and its definition in english as well as hindi when i asked her father told me that she started reciting these shlokas since she was only five years old i asked where she learned it from they said we do not have any idea then i asked if she only reads geetha or does she read something else as well her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once she has everything memorized by the evening if she picks history she knows everything by the evening he told me that the whole family is surprised at this amazing talent the girl has i was really very impressed sometimes kids become obsessed with celebrities sonam did not have any such obsessions i felt this girl is god gifted meeting these kids was a very special experience that i had on my kashi visit so i thought i must share it with you we do a lot of things other than what you see on the tv and read in the newspapers sometimes we enjoy doing these things as well similarly i will always cherish the memories of this encounter with these kids i noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in mann ki baat look what sandeep from haryana has to say sir i want you to do mann ki baat a weekly chore rather than a monthly program because we get very inspired by your words sandeep ji what all will you make me do i have to struggle even to make it to the monthly programme have to make adjustments to my time table sometimes our friends at akashwani have to wait for an hour or so i still respect your feelings i am thankful to you for your suggestion for now we will stick to the one month program only mann ki baat in a way has completed a year do you know how much did subhash babu use the radio he started his own show from germany and he would constantly update the indian citizens about the independence movement through radio he started the azad hind radio through a weekly news bulletin english hindi bengali marathi punjabi pashto urdu he used to run the radio in all these languages i have also completed a year since i started mann ki baat my mann ki baat has in the true sense become your mann ki baat i listen to you i think for you i look into your suggestions and that triggers a thought process in me which reaches you through akashvani i speak but the words are yours and this gives me immense satisfaction we shall meet next month again for mann ki baat your suggestions should keep coming in the government gets benefited by your suggestions it helps to initiate improvement your contribution is priceless for me once again many congratulations to all of you thank you ,Modi thanked everyone for a successful one year of Mann ki Baat. Modi talked about Subhas Chandra Bose and how Bose had launched the Azad Hind Radio. He also mentioned the silent revolution of LPG subsidies.
22-Feb-15,"The text you provided is a message from Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, to students who were preparing for their exams, likely around February 22, 2015. In this message, Prime Minister Modi acknowledges the stress and pressure students feel during exams and offers words of encouragement. He emphasizes the importance of self-confidence and a positive mindset during exams. Modi encourages students to focus on mastering their subjects and believing in their abilities. He advises against comparing oneself to others and emphasizes the value of competing with one's own limits to achieve personal growth. Additionally, he suggests that exams should be viewed as an opportunity to realize one's potential rather than as a demonstration of capacity. Modi also advocates for a more relaxed and joyful approach to exams, suggesting that they could be celebrated as a festival. He concludes by extending his best wishes to the students and expressing his confidence in their success.

The message provides a positive and motivational perspective on facing exams and dealing with the associated stress and expectations.",22-feb-2015 hello my young friends today probably the entire day you must have been preoccupied with the ongoing cricket match on the one hand you have exams and on the other this world cup you might be asking your younger sister to tell you the score of the match from time to time sometimes you must be elated about the fact that holi is around the corner and then suddenly you would be feeling disappointed that even holi festivities will go in for a toss why because the exams are approaching and i am sure you must be feeling this way but friends i am there with you in your moment of crisis this is an important occasion for you hence i am there to offer my support i am not here to lecture you i intend to have some light conversations with you you have been studying hard and you are tired mother scolds you and so does your father and teachers god only knows what all you have to hear day in and out keep the phone switch off the tv entire day you are glued to the computer everyday you must be hearing the same things be it the class x or the class xii the whole year long you might be getting to hear the same things and you might be sincerely wishing that sooner the exams finish better it will be isn t it i understand your mental condition and hence i am here to share mann ki baat with you but this topic is a little difficult as far as today s topic is concerned the parents might be wishing that i touch those issues that they cannot discuss with their children teachers must be wishing that i say the right things to the kids and the students might be wishing that i say things which might ease the pressure at home i do not know who will benefit from my conversation but i will have the satisfaction to know that i was there with my young friends in the most important occasion of their life that i was sharing my inner feelings with them this is my idea behind the conversations i do not have the right to guide you on how to write a paper or how to pass the exams well i cannot guide you on the tricks to obtain better marks because i consider myself an average student on such issues i have myself never scored well in any exams in my life i was a very average student and on top of that i had a very bad handwriting so i think that most of the time i passed the exams as the teachers could not comprehend my handwriting well so much for the light talks but today i want to definitely tell you something important how you approach exams goes a long way in deciding the results of your exams there are many people i have seen who view this as the most important challenge of their lives and they believe that a failure here means failure for life but friends this is not so and so don t take undue stress yes you must be determined to get good results the determination should be strong and the motivation high but the exams should not be a burden this is not the exam which is going to test your performance in life so do not bother much about it sometimes don t you think we tend to make exams a huge burden and the reason behind this is that if we have friends and relatives who have children studying in the same class as your child if your child and your relative s child are also in class tenth then there is constant comparison there is a feeling that our child should fare better than everyone else s child even your friend s child and it is this constant comparison that creates a pressure on your child you feel that your child earns a name amongst the family and friends but is it really his name or your own prestige that you are worried about don t you feel that you are the one responsible for making your child a part of an undue competition can t we associate him to larger vision and greater meaning of life how does he cope with the competition to be same as your neighbor s friend circle and is this really what you want just give s thought on it just think in trying to compete with others how you have belittle your own child s life is it fair when you talk to children talk about big dreams talk of greater heights that can be achieved and you will see a change happening friends there is something that always bothers us we always measure our success in comparison to others our entire energy is spent in useless competition there are many points in life where competition is necessary but for self development competition with others might not be a good motivator but competing with oneself each day should be the primary motivation so start competing with yourself compete with yourself to do better to do faster to do more and to reach new heights concentrate on compete with yourself to make today better than the past and you will find that this spirit of competition will give you such a lot of joy and satisfaction that you yourself can t imagine we remember the athlete sergei bubka very fondly this athlete broke his own records over 35 times he would test himself only every time he would set himself a new challenge and scale new heights you also follow the same and then see that nothing can stop you from achieving success dear friends even students are of different types some people irrespective of the exams they may face they are always happy about it while some just collapse under the burden of exams and some keep hiding behind the books in some corner of the house but despite the type exams are still exams and it is necessary to pass in them and i also wish that you pass well but sometimes you must have noticed that we are seeking some causes externally we seek reasons outside when we are confused about ourselves we do not have faith in ourselves as if we are giving some exam for the first time if someone is watching tv and the pitch is loud we get irritated if the mother calls for food we are irritated but at the same time if our friend calls up we end up chatting for an hour don t you think that you have some confusion about yourself friends it is important for you to identify yourself just keep doing simple things you do need to go far if you have a sister or your friend has a sister and who is appearing in x or xii standard exam just observe them you will see whether it is x or xii the girls will definitely help the mothers in the household chores have you ever thought that how do they manage to do work and yet score well in exams nowadays the girls are far ahead of boys in examination results just observe this around you this will make you realize that issues that bother you are not external sometimes the reasons are internal if you are in self doubt then confidence cannot help and that is why i say that as confidence dips blind faith starts to envelope us and we then start seeking excuses outside some students are such that we call them aarambhishura everyday a new thought everyday a new desire everyday a new resolution and then this resolution dies an early death and we are left where we started i clearly believe that these ever changing desires are called whims by the people friend family and relatives make fun of you and hence i would suggest that you have fixed desires these desires in turn will become resolutions and resolutions can never be futile resolutions are accompanied by goals and when goals and action come together resolutions are achieved that is why i say desire stability resolution resolution action achievements i have complete faith that in your life too achievements will be at your feet if only you dedicate yourself dedicate yourself to your commitment and keep it positive don t be bothered about defeating others think of taking yourself further from where you already are and so test yourself everyday against your own limits so that however big a challenge in life comes we will not have any problem and why should someone else take our exam make it a habit to take your exam yourself each day we will test ourselves we will see if we have progressed from where we were yesterday have i reached further than yesterday have i achieved more than what i achieved yesterday each day every moment keep testing yourself then such tests will bother you no more in life every exam will be an opportunity to test and regulate oneself and someone who can regulate himself knows to face challenges boldly and so who sets himself challenges of life finds these classroom exams very small sometimes we far exceed our own expectations just try and remember the good works that you have done you will be surprised at your own achievement last year you were sick and yet you got good marks last year your uncle got married one full week got wasted but still you managed to score very well earlier you would sleep for six hours and then last year you decided you will sleep for only five hours and you did it what advice can modi give you you become your own advisor and as lord buddha said uppa deepo bhavahah it is my belief that one should recognize one s inner light recognize one s potential those who set themselves a new limit each time are the ones who scale greater heights secondly sometimes we are busy thinking about the distant future some people live in the past don t do so during your exams during examinations it is better to be in the present does a batsman anytime try and recall when he was out for a duck or does he think whether we will win this entire series or not once he enters a match does he think that i will come out only after hitting a century not really in my opinion a good batsman is focused on the ball he is facing he does not think of the next ball or of the match or of entire series you also fix your mind in the present to win there is only one formula live in the present connect with the present victory will be yours my dear friends do you think exams are meant to exhibit your capacity if this is what you think then you are wrong who do you have to show your capacity who do you need to demonstrate it to you should think that these exams are not to demonstrate your capacity but to realize your own potential if you make this basic mantra your calling your confidence will get a new boost once you realize your potential and understand yourself then you yourself will keep fostering your strengths this strength will translate into a new potential and so don t take exams as a medium of exhibition take it as an opportunity this is an opportunity to know oneself to explore oneself and to be living with oneself so live on my friends friends i have seen that there are many students who become nervous during exams some go to the extent that look today was my exam and mama did not even wish me uncle did not wish me and elder brother did not wish me and probably this issue is debated for an hour or two in the family who did not wish who called up to wish did he send flowers or not friends rise above all this do not get involved in all this think about all this when exams are over if you have faith in yourself then such things will not arise i have seen that many students become nervous i know that some people have the tendency to become nervous some families have such an environment i believe that the reason for nervousness is the lack of faith in oneself how do you get this faith in yourself if you gain mastery in your subject you have worked hard and have done multiple revisions if you have the confidence that you have mastery in some subject you will see that out of the 5 7 subjects there are only 2 3 topics for which you are never worried nervousness is about some one or two topics if you have mastered the subject you will not be nervous all the hard work that you have done in the past year all those books that you have studied through the night they will not go waste it will be there somewhere in your mind as soon as you sit on your examination desk it will come back to you you should trust your knowledge your information have the faith that all the hard work you have done will certainly bear fruit and secondly be confident about your strengths you should have the faith that however difficult the exam is you will crack it successfully however lengthy the exam is i will successfully complete it you should be confident about the timing be it a two hour or a three hour paper that you will finish it before time i still remember maybe you have been told too our teachers instructed us to do easy questions first and tackle the difficult ones later i believe someone must have told you the same and i believe that you will follow it friends i have received many suggestions and experiences on mygov in i will pass them on to the education ministry but i would like to mention a few things here arnav mohta writes from mumbai maharashtra that some people make these exams an issue of life and death as if entire world will finish if one fails these exams vinita tiwari writes from varanasi that the news of children committing suicide on the declaration of these results saddens her you too must be hearing such news but i have got good response from it from another gentleman mr r kamath has send in some good words he has asked the students not to become worriers but warriors really we should not sink in worries but should be a warrior in the battlefield i believe that we should not drown in our worries we should march ahead with the belief that victory will be ours life is very long there are ups and downs but one should not perish with them sometimes unwanted results are an indication to move forward they give us the opportunity to find new strength i have also witnessed another thing students as soon as they are out of the examination hall they start estimating how they fared friends and family too ask the same question how was today s paper whatever is finished is over please forget about it i would also request the parents not to ask such questions as soon as he gets out say oh the glow on your face says that you have done well ok good let us go and prepare for tomorrow create this mood and friends i also tell you what will be the impact if you calculate and come to know that two questions are wrong and you would lose 6 marks then tell me will it not impact your performance the other day so why waste time on this why waste your energy on this after all the exams are over whatever calculations you want to make you are free to do them how many marks will be scored that should not be your concern at the time of exams after the paper finishes concentrate on the next day s paper forget the day s paper and you will see your burden lessening by 20 25 quite a few thoughts are rising in my mind i do not know if they will be useful now that the exams are near but i would like to tell my educator and academician friends that can t we celebrate a week long exam festival twice in a year in each term it should have a sarcastic poetry session or a cartoon competition a debate competition there should be someone to lecture on the psychological aspects of exams so that this tension around the exams gets eliminated if exams become a celebration then the students would not need to spend time like the way they are doing today in hearing this out the students will themselves become confident also i believe that while teaching the syllabus a separate lecture should be conducted on topics pertaining to exams this environment of tension is not conducive friends i know that whatever i am telling you you must have heard a lot more than that your parents must have lectured you so must have the teachers i do not want to confuse you by talking more on this subject i want to believe that all the sons and daughters of this land who are going to give exams remain happy and joyful and give exams with a free mind i am talking to make you happy you will get good results you will be successful make exams a celebration give exams in a joyful mood enjoy achievement each day and change the entire atmosphere parents teachers and school all should get together and experience what it is like to challenge the challenges how wonderful it feels to convert each moment into an opportunity and remember you cannot please everyone in the world i had a penchant for writing poetry i had written a poem in gujarati i don t remember it fully but i had written in it if successful then you are worth being envious of if failed then you are nowhere this is the way of the world be successful not to defeat others but to overcome your challenges be successful for your own pleasure be successful for bringing pleasure to the lives of those others living in this world i have this faith that you will succeed with happiness in your heart you will have great success and then whether we could celebrate holi or not whether we could attend uncle s marriage or not whether i could attend friend s birthday party or not could see the cricket world cup or not all these things will become immaterial as for now your dimensions of happiness will be very different my best wishes to you nation s future is as bright as your own future india s future will be defined by india s youth it will be defined by you be it the sons or daughters both have to work in tandem to take the country forward come make the exam festival into a celebration my best wishes to you ,i am here to share my thoughts with you today on the subject of exams and how to approach exams in a positive way. i have seen many people who view exams as the most important challenge of their lives and they believe that a failure here means failure for life.
22-Mar-15,"In this address from March 22, 2015, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke directly to farmers across the country. He expressed his gratitude for their questions and concerns, acknowledging the challenges they face in their lives. He promised to address these issues, emphasizing the importance of understanding and solving farmers' problems. 

Modi discussed problems farmers face, such as land acquisition, lack of irrigation, inadequate roads, rising fertilizer prices, and the difficulties they encounter when selling their produce. He explained the changes made to the land acquisition bill and dispelled misconceptions surrounding the law, asserting that it was not against the interests of the farmers. He emphasized the need for flexibility in acquiring land for development projects, taking into consideration the consent of the affected parties.

The Prime Minister also introduced initiatives like the Soil Health Card to improve farming practices and yield. He assured the farmers that he would work towards making them self-reliant and increasing their happiness. The address concluded with greetings for the festival of Navratri and an invitation for farmers to write to him with their concerns.",22-mar-2015 greetings to all my dear farmer brothers and sisters today i feel so fortunate to avail this opportunity to speak with my farmer brothers and sisters from different corners of the country when i speak to farmers i speak to the village and its residents and also to the farm labourers i am also speaking to the mothers and sisters who work on the farm fields and in this context probably this feeling is a little different from all the interactions i had through mann ki baat when i decided to speak about farmers in mann ki baat i never expected that the farmers from far off villages across the country would be willing to ask numerous questions and would provide such information i was taken aback to receive your numerous letters and questions in such huge numbers i can say that you all are very aware and active and you all probably yearn that somebody listens to you first of all i would like to express my heartfelt greetings to you all i have read your letters and understood the agony and struggle in your lives despite bearing so much misery i cannot imagine what all you have gone through in your lives you all have taken me aback but i take this mann ki baat to be an opportunity for education and experience my dear farmer brothers and sisters i would like to assure you that all your questions and queries from different aspects that you brought to my notice would be addressed by me and i will bring consciousness and sensitivity on those subjects in my government and not let my village my poor people my farmer brothers will not be forced to live in this pathetic condition i am shocked farmers have written letters related to farming but they have also brought some other issues like the problems they face with the village mafias and gangs i can understand the problems related to natural calamities but they are also facing the issues with small time businessmen some farmers have to drink contaminated water in their villages some have raised concerns on the facilities to provide shelter to their cattle and some have also mentioned that there is no facility to dispose off the dead animals which leads to various diseases among the villagers this suggests that today through mann ki baat the governing bodies are getting a unique chance to understand numerous problems of the farmers we can attain our rights to govern the country only when we can understand and provide solution to all these small but important issues i feel so embarrassed when i read your letters and think what we have done so far i have no answer to this question what have we done yes you words have touched my heart i will try my best to bring a change and would awaken the sleeping government to run in the most appropriate manner this will be my primary focus and that is a promise from my side i am aware that you had to face great difficulties last year due to scarcity of rain this year due to the unseasonal rain and hail storm all the states above maharashtra had to bear a lot of difficulties farmers across all the corners of the country had to face great difficulties a poor farmer who leads his life through slogging in the fields has no other source of living or income i am with you in this difficult time of your life our government is also taking stock of the situation minutely on various issues of the farmer and is in touch with different departments of the state the ministers are also out in the field visiting various states and collecting reviews and analysing its situation i have also asked the state governments to work closely along with the central government and strive to help as much as possible to our farmer brothers and sisters in this situation i can assure you that the government will take proper steps and solve your problems promptly and help you in this difficult time we will do whatever is possible to help you and do our best to fulfil those villagers and farmers have raised various issues irrigation problem is one of the most important issues farmers are also angry due to the unavailability of roads in villages they are also unhappy about the increasing price of fertilizers there is no electricity they are also unhappy about the fact that they are unable to educate their children which in their wish is also a complaint mothers and sisters are angry with the drug abuse prevailing in the villages some women have also addressed the issues of tobacco intake by their husbands i can understand your pain some farmers believe that they can only hear the strategies adopted by the government but it never reaches the villagers farmers have mentioned that they slog day and night to provide food to the entire nation but they never receive the full amount of money in return when they go out to sell the crops and other farm products there is no one to buy from us so they are left with no other option than to sell the products at lower prices they are doomed in both the case if they produce more or less this means farmers have brought to my notice their inner thoughts through their letters i can assure all my farmer brothers and sisters that the state and central government will take proper steps actively from now on i will inspire the government to speed up the actions and provide solutions to all your problems i can understand that you are losing patience this is quite natural as you have waited for sixty long years i will try to find a full proof solution to this my farmer brothers i have found one primary problem among your various questions that is the acquisition of land bill prevailing in almost all the states i am shocked to hear these rumours spread across the country it is good that you have raised such small issues and questions i will try to bring the truth before you you must be aware that the acquisition of land bill was passed 120 years ago post independence this law was practised till 60 65 years today the activists who call themselves as the supporters of farmers also practised this law in the country governed the country and the farmers got their share everybody believed that there should be a change in this law and i too believed in the change we were in the opposition and we too believed in the change of law in the year 2013 a new law was passed in haste we too supported this law giving our full support to the government if a law benefits the farmers who would not like to support it so we too supported the law but after the initiation of the law some of the concerns got raised in our minds we felt that this way we would be betraying the hopes of farmers we do not have any rights to betray the farmers on one side when our government was formed we saw that all the states raised their voice to amend the law to improve the law the law must be modified to plug the loop holes on the other side we found that no state is ready to implement the law only maharashtra and haryana governments under congress rule had implemented the law who proclaim to be well wishers of farmers they brought an ordinance and decided to provide just half of the decided amount as compensation what kind of justice is this to the farmers after reviewing all these points we felt that there should be some re thinking when things are done in haste then some drawbacks remain the motive might be good but if there are drawbacks then they should be rectified now i will speak of most primary drawback which you all will find quite astonishing all the people who are self proclaimed well wishers of farmers are not ready to give any answers to these questions are you all aware that there are 13 different laws in our country through which most of our country s land like railway national highway and minefields is acquired are you aware that in the law of previous government these 13 areas have been excluded from the law with this exclusion i mean that the farmers would receive the same compensation as they used to get under the previous law you tell me is this not a drawback this was a mistake or not this was a mistake or not we have modified this law and the farmers would receive four times the compensation even if these 13 areas be used for railways or highways we have tried to improve the law who would say that this amendment is against the farmers this is why we had brought an ordinance if we wouldn t have brought the enactment the lands of farmers would have been used according to the previous law and they would not have received their compensation when this law was passed many in the government too raised their voice against this law even those who were involved in the making of the law got upset and said that this law is neither beneficial to the farmers nor the village or to the country this law can be useful it was said only to fill the treasury of the officers and for their enjoyment to promote red tapism if this was the truth apt modifications should have been done or not thus we have tried to eliminate the drawbacks of the law and work on the direction of betterment of the farmers firstly we have included the 13 laws which were excluded under the acquisition of land bill so that the farmers are provided with the remuneration and all rights and they do not have to incur loss due to the exclusion i have heard the rumours being spread that modi government is passing a law which will provide less remuneration to the farmers and they will not receive the full compensation my dear farmer brothers and sisters i cannot even think of committing this sin in the year 2013 under the dispensation of previous government the compensation which was decided has not been modified a bit we have decided to provide four times the compensation than the one provided earlier not only this we have also included the 13 areas which were excluded in the earlier law we have also continued with the clause that in case of acquisition of land for development of the city the land owners will receive 20 of the developed land so that they are benefited financially at all times the youth of the family gets a job we have also decided to provide employment to the children of the farmers we have also added a new programme the new addition is that the district authorities will have to announce that who will be employed from the family in what field they will be employed and what will be their work location government will have to provide written announcement for the same we have fixed the government responsibility by adding this feature my dear farmer brother and sisters we all agree that the government land must be used first post this the barren land must be used lastly when there is no option left the farm lands can be touched so we have started a survey for finding all the barren lands for making it a priority for usage we have received complaints from our farmers that more than the required land is for use is gobbled up with the enactment of this new law i can assure you that before using the land a survey will be conducted and then it will be decided so that more than the required land is not acquired sometimes in the foresight that something is going to happen there is lot of damage in the name of social impact assessment sia if these judicial proceedings are carried on for several years how can a farmer take a right decision in this situation he cannot decide whether to grow the crops in the field as he is in a fix as he will keep thinking that the judgement can come any day this will lead to two to four years of loss and things will be stuck due to red tapism due to the long and difficult proceedings a poor farmer is forced to beg before the officers to get their work done sir please write this please do not write this this is going to happen that is going to happen i do not want my farmers to fall prey to these officers i do not think this is a right thing to do procedures were long and difficult i have tried to make this procedure simple and easy my dear farmer brothers and sisters the law was passed in the year 2014 but the states have not adopted the law yet farmers are still at the same place states have opposed this law please tell me if i should listen to the states or not i should trust the states or not how can a country run without trusting its own states so i believe we should trust our states and we should specially trust our central government one i am willing to trust my states and secondly the improvement we are trying to bring in the law by trying to eliminate the drawbacks and trying to better the conditions of the farmers even after this if the states are not ready to support this movement they are free to do so that is why i would like to request you all not to fall prey to these rumours these rumours are absolutely against farmer rumours it is part of the conspiracy of keeping the farmers poor as always this is a part of the conspiracy of not taking the country forward we have to save ourselves from this conspiracy and save our country and save our farmers as well now if one were to ask the farmer residing in the village that what are your plans for your three sons he will respond that one of them will carry on with the farming but the other two will have to seek jobs elsewhere so now even the sons of farmers are seeking out jobs they too have to move out and seek employment somewhere so arrangements need to be made for that too so we have decided that whatever is important for the welfare of the village welfare of the farmer and whatever is important for the employment of members of the farming community all such things should be connected we are the ones who believe in jai jawan jai kisan jai jawan is related to the security of the country as far as the security of the nation is concerned the farmers of the nation do not ever step back from their responsibilities if some land is required for national security we will have to ask the farmers for it and i have complete faith that the farmers will give us the land so we have added the clause for taking land for such purposes i want to ask each and every member of the village is road required or not if water is required in the fields don t we need to create canals there are still many poor families in the village who do not have a house to live in is not land required for construction of houses tell me is this for the industrialists is this land being demanded for the ultra rich try and understand the truth yes there is something i want to announce without a doubt in the new ordinance too any private industrialist owner of a manufacturing unit will have to follow the same set of rules that were laid out in the land acquisition act of 2013 the rules for the corporates are the same as in 2013 then why this lies are being spread my farmer brother and sisters misunderstanding is being created that you will not get your legal rights that you cannot approach the courts this is entirely false no government at the centre can take away your legal rights the constitution given to us by baba saheb ambedkar ensures that you can approach any court in any part of the country all we have done is to bring some sort of system to your doorsteps we have created an authority now this authority will work at district level and the issues of the farmers will be resolved at the district level itself by the authority and if you are not satisfied with the solutions offered there you can approach the courts as well this is the arrangement we have made there is a misconception that the law related to returning the acquired land in five years has been scrapped this is not true dear farmer brothers and sisters what we have said whenever a project is undertake a timeline has to be specified in terms of the number of years in which it will be completed if the project is not completed in the specified time period then whatever farmer s wish has to be adhered to so we have set a timeframe for government projects what is the today s case scenario those lands which were acquired about 40 years ago the government has not done anything on them this cannot continue any longer we have decided to set a time limit to governmental projects yes there are projects which take time maybe around 20 years for example if 500 km long railway track is to be laid then it will take time so we want it all written down the time frame in which a project will be completed so what we are doing is fixing the liability of the government we have fixed the government s responsibility let me also tell you something dear farmer brothers those sitting in the air conditioned rooms who formulate these rules have no idea of the condition of the villagers whenever a dam is made or a reservoir is constructed the rule is to acquire land till the point where there is a possibility of water getting to the maximum level in a span of 100 years so the water gets filled once in 100 years for 99 years no water gets filled yet the land lies with the government what is currently happening in the states is that land has been acquired compensation paid and yet farmers are working on those lands if the land gets flooded once in 100 years that year the land can be taken the law of 2013 denied the farmers the right to cultivate the land all we want is that if the land does not get flooded then it should be available for farmers for cultivation and hence that land should not be acquired from the farmer this kind of flexibility is necessary so the farmer benefits even after giving up the land and also get compensation in lieu of their land this will doubly benefit the farmers this kind of organization is both necessary and practical and we are the ones who have thought about it another misconception being spread is that consent is not necessary i urge you my brothers and sisters to protect yourself from such politically motivated propaganda the law which was promulgated in 2013 has no provision for consent in schemes for which the government is acquiring land so people are being misled on this consent issue the issue of consent did not exist previously it does not exist now and so my brothers and sisters to say that it was beneficial for you before but it is not so now this is an unfortunate attempt to mislead you i assure and insist that this consent clause is very much functional in case of private industries corporate and individual enterprise another thing i would like to share that some people talk about the ppp model dear brother and sisters if a road worth rs 100 crores is made will the corporate run away with it the ownership of the road will be with the government the ownership of the land is with the government the construction agency is different the construction agency is different because the government does not have the requisite amount of money the government wants that a road be made in the village as well as hospital and the poor children get education so monetary investment is required the private investors construct roads but not for themselves he does not take it with himself he makes it for the government in a way he invests his money this means in a government project someone else puts in the money which is called the ppp model but the ownership rests with the government and government means of all of you of the 125 crore indians and hence we have said there that there is no need for a consent hence it was necessary for me to dispel these myths around the ppp model sometimes this issue of consent will increase red tapism and nepotism tell me there is a village a road has been constructed till that village now a road has to be constructed till the next village which is 5 kms ahead the road for the first village has been made but the land for the road to other village lies with the previous village so tell me will the villagers wilfully give land for road till the other village tell me will they give their consent so what sin have the people of other village committed should they not get the roads similarly if i am making a canal this village has got the water and we have to provide water supply to another village and the said land falls with the people of the previous village who already have water and they deny giving their consent for acquiring their land and say that we already have the water we are not going to give consent for land acquisition for supply of water to another village so now you tell me the people of the other village should get water or not my brothers and sisters this is a practical issue so we are evolving a process which does not take long this is for the farmers right not for industries and industrialists it is for the betterment of the villages the villagers and the benefit of their children another issue is coming up i have said this before in every farmer family the farmer wants one son to do farming and the others to take up other sources of employment such are the times today that different efforts need to be mad to run the household if we make a road and government establishes an industrial corridor next to it which is not private i again reiterate that a corridor by the government not for the rich or the industrialists so if the government makes a corridor on the left or right of a 50 or 100 km road then all the residents of the near those villages maybe 50 100 200 villages falling along it will have an opportunity for employment their kin will get employment tell me dear brother and sisters do we want the children of our villages to suffocate in the slums of delhi and mumbai should they not get an employment opportunity closer to their home if a small industry comes up some 20 25 kms away from their village so this corridor will be made by the government and will not be private the government will make these corridors and create these employment opportunities for the villagers this proposal is about government ownership it is for the betterment of the villages betterment of the farmers of villages it is for the betterment of the future generations of the villagers it is for the betterment of the poor of the villages it is to make electricity available to the villages for these there were some drawbacks in the last land acquisition bill which we have tried to resolve all the shortcomings of this bill authentically still i have maintained in the parliament that if anyone feels that there are some short comings we are ready to make amendments when we put the bill in the parliament certain leaders of the farming community gave us some suggestions and we added them we still say that the land acquisition should be pro farmers we are committed for this there are lot of lies being spread i request you dear brothers to not get swayed and don t make your decision based on these lies important issue is how to make farmers strong how to make our villages strong the farmer should get the right price for his efforts farmers should get a proper market a proper storage for his production it is our effort to make right decisions for the betterment of the village and the farmers dear brothers and sisters it is our effort to see that the nation progresses and so do our farmers by increasing their yield and so we have introduced soil health card if a person falls sick a laboratory test is undertaken for them similarly a lab test can be undertaken for our motherland so we are working not only to protect your land but also to make it healthy and so not land acquisition but making the land healthy is our task and so we have introduced the concept of soil health card every farmer is going to benefit from it your undue expenses on fertilizers will be saved your yield will increase that you get proper price for your production there should be proper granaries proper rules and regulations and that you are saved from exploitation we are working on all these issues i remember when i was the chief minister of gujarat i worked a lot in this direction the condition of farmers in our gujarat was very bad we worked on the water issues and we saw a big change the farmers made a huge contribution to the development of gujarat which was beyond all expectations the entire villages would be deserted but the change happened we want this type of change in the entire country which makes our farmers very happy and so my farmer brother and sisters today i got an opportunity to talk to you but the issue of the ordinance is making headlines every day and i chose to speak about it more but my dear brothers and sisters i will speak to you again and on other issues but i want to assure you that whatever you have written to me i will shake the entire government and will make them see the reality about what is actually happening on the ground i am happy that you have told me so many things and i believe that you have told me because you trust me i want to assure you that i will not shatter your faith i desire your love and blessings at all times you are the elders of the nation you can never think wrong for others rather you will suffer loses for other s benefit this has been your tradition and these farmers do not suffer should have to be the prime focus of my government today after hearing this mann ki baat many thoughts may have arisen in your mind please do write into me at the akashvani address i will talk again based on your letters i will try to rectify all the mistakes of my government i will try to speed up the efforts and if somewhere injustice is being done i will try and provide justice we are in middle of the auspicious festival of navratri my heartfelt greetings to you all ,i wish you all the best for the navratri festival and for a better future for the farmers and for the people of the country.
22-May-16,"In his ""Mann Ki Baat"" address on May 22, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on several important topics. He discussed the rising temperatures and the importance of environmental conservation, particularly as World Environment Day was approaching. He highlighted the need to save forests, conserve water, and expand forest cover. PM Modi also mentioned his discussions with the Chief Ministers of eleven drought-affected states and the importance of finding permanent solutions to tackle drought and water conservation.

He emphasized the need for a cashless society, encouraging people to embrace electronic payments and the use of mobile technology for banking transactions. PM Modi also urged citizens to support and encourage Indian athletes participating in the Rio Olympics, promoting a positive atmosphere for sports in the country.

PM Modi addressed the issue of unrealistic expectations in academic achievements, citing instances where high achievers still face dissatisfaction. He stressed the importance of celebrating achievements and not setting unattainable goals. Finally, he discussed the significance of cleanliness and yoga in maintaining good health and encouraged people to participate in International Yoga Day on June 21.

PM Modi also announced a simpler method for listening to his ""Mann Ki Baat"" program by dialing a four-digit number, 1922, to access it in various languages. He concluded by reminding citizens to conserve water during the coming months.",22-may-2016 my dear countrymen namaskar once again i have got an opportunity to talk to you about matters close to my heart through mann ki baat for me mann ki baat is not a matter of ritual i myself am very eager to talk to you and i am really happy that i am able to connect with you all in every corner of india through this programme mann ki baat i am grateful to all india radio that they have also been successfully broadcasting mann ki baat in regional languages at 8 pm i am also very happy that the people who listen to me later communicate their feelings to me through letters telephone calls the website mygov in and also through the narendramodiapp a lot of what you say is of great help to me in the functioning of the government how active should the government be in terms of public service how much priority should be given to public welfare activities in terms of these matters this dialogue this link that i have with you all is of great use i hope that you will now be even more actively and enthusiastically involved in ensuring that our democracy should function with people s participation the summer heat is increasing day by day we were hoping for some respite instead we are experiencing continual rise in temperature and in the midst of this came the information that the monsoon will perhaps be delayed by a week which has added to the worry almost the entire country is reeling under the scorching impact of severe heat the mercury continues to soar be it animals birds or humans everyone is suffering these problems have been getting increasingly worse due to environmental degradation forest cover has kept receding due to indiscriminate felling of trees in a way the human race itself has paved the way for self annihilation by destroying the environment 5th june is world environment day on this day discussions expressing concern on the issue are held all over the world for saving the environment this time on the occasion of world environment day the united nations has given the theme zero tolerance for illegal wildlife trade this topic will of course be discussed but we also must talk about saving our flora and fauna conserving water and how to expand our forest cover you must have seen in the last few days how forest fires raged in the lap of the himalayas in uttarakhand himachal pradesh and jammu and kashmir the main cause of these forest fires was dry leaf littering combined with carelessness which led to the massive inferno and so it becomes the bounden duty of each one of us to save forests and save water recently i convered at length with the chief ministers of eleven states reeling under severe drought uttar pradesh rajasthan gujarat maharashtra madhya pradesh chhattisgarh jharkhand karnataka andhra pradesh telangana and odisha as per the conventional government precedent i could have had a combined meeting with all the drought affected states but i chose not to do so i had a one on one meeting with each state devoting about two to two and a half hours with each one i carefully heard what each state had to say usually such talks do not go beyond discussion on how much money was granted by the central government state wise and how much money was actually spent by each state thus it came as a surprise even to the officers of the central government that some states have indeed made some very commendable efforts related to water environment tackling drought caring for animals as well as affected human beings based on inputs from all corners of the country irrespective of the ruling party there we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long standing problem in a way it was a kind of a learning experience too for me and i have told the niti aayog that they should work on how to incorporate the best practices across all the states some states especially gujarat and andhra pradesh have made full use of technology i would like that in future through the niti aayog the exceptionally successful efforts of these states should be applied to other states also people s participation is a strong base for solving such problems and for this i believe that if there is a confluence of perfect planning use of appropriate technology and time bound action then we can achieve optimum results in drought management for water conservation to save every single drop of water my faith is that water is a gift from god when we go to a temple we are given an offering of prasad and even if a small bit of that spills we feel bad in our hearts we not only pick it up but also pray five times for god s forgiveness water is also an offering form the god even if a drop of water is wasted then we should feel remorse and pain and so water storage water conservation and proper water irrigation are all of equal importance and so there is need for implementing the maxim per drop more crop through micro irrigation and cultivating crops that require minimal water intake at present it is indeed good news that in many states even sugarcane farmers are using micro irrigation some are using drip irrigation and some are using sprinklers when i discussed with the eleven states i noticed that even for cultivating paddy for production of rice some of them had employed drip irrigation successfully and got higher yields thereby also reducing the requirement for water as well as for labour i also found that there were many states which had taken on very big targets especially maharashtra andhra pradesh and gujarat these three states have done massive work in the field of drip irrigation and they are striving to bring every year 2 to 3 lakh hectares additional land under micro irrigation if this campaign gets underway in all the states then not only will it benefit cultivation but more water will also be conserved our farmer brothers in telangana through mission bhagirathi have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of godavari and krishna rivers in andhra pradesh neeru pragati mission has been using technology for ground water recharging people are devoting hard work and contributing financially as well to the mass movement that has been started in maharashtra jal yukt shivir is one such people s movement which is really going to be of great help in saving maharashtra from water crisis in the future this is what i feel chhattisgarh has started the lok suraj jal suraj campaign madhya pradesh has started the balram talaab yojana and dug nearly 22 000 ponds which is no small figure work is also being carried out on their kapil dhara koop yojana in uttar pradesh there is mukhya mantri jal bachao abhiyaan in karnataka water conservation efforts are in the form of kalyani yojana under which they are trying to revive wells once again in rajasthan and gujarat there are many ancient baodis deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water these states are making a very big effort to revive these as water temples rajasthan has started the chief minister s jal swawalamban abhiyan water self sufficiency campaign jharkhand although being a predominantly forest area still has some parts which face water problem they have launched a very big campaign for building check dams they have started an exercise to check and stop the flow of water some states have started a campaign and made a number of small dams at distances of 10 to 20 kilometres in the rivers themselves to check the flow of water this is a wonderful experience i urge the people of india that during this june july august september we should resolve that we shall not let a single drop of water be wasted we should decide right now upon the places where we can conserve water and where we can check the flow of water the almighty blesses us with water according to our needs nature fulfils our needs but if we become careless during the abundance of water and then during the lean water season land into trouble due to water scarcity how can this be allowed and the issue of water is not just for the farmers this concerns everybody the villages the poor the labourers the farmers the urban people the country folk the rich and the poor and for this reason now that the rainy season is approaching saving water should be our priority and when we celebrate diwali this time then we should also revel in how much water did we save how much water we stopped from flowing out you will see for yourselves that our joy will increase manifold water has this power no matter how tired one is just a bit of water splashed on the face makes one feel so refreshed no matter how tired we are when we see a large lake or an ocean how magnificent that sight is what a priceless treasure it is bestowed upon us by the almighty just connect to it with your heart conserve it we should harvest water we should also store water we should also modernise water irrigation this i say as an earnest appeal we should not let this season go waste the coming four months should be transformed into a save the water campaign to save every drop of water and this is not just for the governments not just for the politicians it is a work to be carried out by the people at large recently the media reported about the water crisis in great detail i hope that the media will show the path to the people on how to save water start a campaign and also share the responsibility to free us from the water crisis forever i invite then as well my dear countrymen we have to build a modern india we have to make a transparent india we have to make many services uniformly available across the entire country from one corner to another so we will have to change some of our old habits as well today i want to touch upon one topic in which if you can be of help to me then we can together achieve progress in that direction we all know and we were taught about it in school that there was a time when there were no coins no currency notes there was a barter system if you wanted vegetables you could give wheat in return if you wanted salt you could give vegetables in exchange business was carried out only through the barter system then gradually came currency coins came notes came but now times have changed the whole world is moving towards a cashless society through the facility of electronic technology we can get money and also give money we can buy things and pay our bills too and with this there is no question of our wallets getting stolen from our pocket we need not worry about keeping an account the account will be maintained automatically in the beginning it may appear to be a bit difficult but once we get used to it then this arrangement will seem very easy for us and this possibility is there because under the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana that we have started recently nearly all the families in the country have had their bank accounts opened on the other hand they have also got their aadhar numbers and the mobile phone has reached the hands of almost every indian so jan dhan aadhar and mobile jam j a m synchronising these three we can move ahead towards a cashless society you must have seen that along with the jan dhan account people have been given a rupay card in the coming days this card is going to be useful as both a credit and a debit card and now a days a very small instrument has come which is called point of sale p o s pos with the help of that be it your aadhar number or your rupay card if you have to pay money to someone you can do it through that there is no need to take out any money from your pocket and count it there is no need to carry around any cash with you one of the initiatives in this regard taken by the government of india is about how to make payments through pos how to receive money the second endeavour we have started is bank on mobile the universal payment interface banking transaction upi will change the way things work it will become very easy to do money transactions through your mobile phone and i m happy to tell you that the n p c i and banks are working together to launch this platform through a mobile app if this happens perhaps you may not even need to carry a rupay card with you across the country nearly 1 25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents in a way we have worked towards providing the bank at your door step post offices have also been geared up for banking services if we learn and adapt ourselves to use these services then we will not require the currency we will not need notes we will not need coins businesses will function automatically resulting in a certain transparency under hand dealings will stop the influence of black money will be reduced so i appeal to my countrymen that we should at least make a beginning once we start we will move ahead with great ease twenty years ago who would have thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands slowly we cultivated a habit and now we can t do without those maybe this cashless society assumes a similar form but the sooner this happens the better it will be my dear countrymen whenever the olympic games come around and when these begin we sit and clutch our heads and sigh we were left so far behind in the tally of gold medals did we get a silver or not should we do with just a bronze or not this happens it is true that in the field of sports we face a lot of challenges but an atmosphere for sports should be created in the country to encourage the sportspersons who are leaving for the rio olympics to boost their morale everyone should try in one s own way someone could write a song someone could draw cartoons someone could send messages with good wishes somebody could cheer a particular sport but on the whole a very positive environment should be created in the entire country for these sportspersons whatever may be the result a game is a game one can win or lose medals are won sometimes and sometimes not our spirits should always soar high and as i speak i would like to mention our sports minister shri sarbanand sonowal for a gesture that has touched my heart last week all of us were busy in the ups downs of assam election results shri sarbanandji himself was leading the campaign he was the chief ministerial candidate but he was also the union minister and i was very happy when i came to know that one day before the assam election results he discreetly reached patiala in punjab you must be aware of the netaji subhash national institute of sports n i s where the sportspersons going for the olympics are trained they all are there he suddenly reached there much to the surprise of the sportspersons and it was a matter of surprise for the world of sports as well that a minister personally cares for our sportspersons what are the arrangements for them how is the food are they getting nutritious food according to their needs or not are the appropriate trainers for their body fitness present there are all the training machines functioning properly he surveyed everything in great detail he personally inspected each and every sportsperson s room he spoke to all the players in great detail he had a word with the management and trainers he himself ate with the sportspersons with election results being due with the distinct possibility of a new responsibility as a chief minister and yet if one of my colleagues in the capacity of a sports minister displays such concern for his work then it gives me great joy and i am confident that like this we should all realize the importance of sports we should encourage the people in the world of sports encourage our sportspersons this becomes a source of strength in itself when the sportsperson feels that his 125 crore countrymen are with him his morale gets boosted last time i spoke to you about the fifa under 17 world cup and recently i got to see the suggestions that have come pouring in and these days i have noticed that a conducive atmosphere for football can be seen in the whole country many people are taking an initiative to form their own teams i have received thousands of suggestions on the narendramodi mobile app maybe many people don t play the game themselves but hundreds of thousands of young indians have displayed such keen interest in the sport this by itself was a very delightful experience for me we all know the bond that india has with cricket but i saw the same passion for football as well and this by itself heralds a very positive signal for the future for all the selected candidates for the rio olympics and for our favourite sportspersons we should create a cheerful and positive atmosphere we should not judge everything in terms of victory and defeat india should be known in the world for its spirit of sportsmanship i appeal to my countrymen to contribute their bit in creating an atmosphere that boosts the spirits and enthusiasm of our athletes in the last week or so results have been pouring in from all over the country and i am not talking about election results i am talking about those students who slogged for the entire year those of 10th and 12th class it is clear that our daughters are marching ahead triumphantly it is a matter of joy to those who have succeeded in these exams i extend my congratulations and felicitations and those who were not able to succeed i would like to tell them once again that there is a lot to do in life life does not get stuck if we do not get results according to our expectations we should live with hope we should move ahead with confidence but i have been confronted with a new type of question about which earlier i had never given a thought i ve received one email on mygov in site which drew my attention one mr gaurav gaurav patel of madhya pradesh writes that in the m p board exam he has secured 89 33 marks reading this i felt elated but in his continued narration he tells us his tale of woes gaurav patel says that sir afte securing 89 33 marks when i reached home i was thinking that i would be congratulated by my family and friends i would be applauded but i was amazed when everybody in the house friends and my teachers said the same thing oh dear if your had secured just 4 more marks you would have made it to 90 so it seems that my family my friends my teachers nobody was pleased with my 89 33 marks everyone was lamenting that i missed my 90 by four marks now i m perplexed and don t know how to handle the situation is this all to life was what i did not good enough did i not prove myself i don t know but i feel a burden on my heart and mind gaurav i have read your letter very carefully and i feel that perhaps this pain is not just yours like you there are many lakhs and crores of other students who share the same pain because nowadays there is a trend that instead of finding satisfaction in what we have achieved we tend to express our dissatisfaction in not achieving unrealistic goals this is another form of negativity we can never guide society towards the path of satisfaction if we always find dissatisfaction in everything it would have been better if your family members your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89 33 then you would have felt motivated enough to do a lot more i would like to urge guardians parents and people all around to please accept welcome and express your satisfaction over your children s results and motivate them to surge ahead in life else it might happen that a day will come when he brings 100 marks and you will say that you have got 100 percent but still had you done something more it would have been better there is a limit to everything and that should be accepted santosh giri goswami has written to me from jodhpur something similar almost along the same lines he says that the people around him just don t accept the results they say that you should have done something better there was a poem i had read long ago i don t remember the complete poem the poet had written something like this i painted a picture of my anguish on the canvas of life and when it was exhibited almost all the visiting people commented that it needed some touching up someone said yellow here would have been better in place of blue someone said this line would have been better situated there instead of here i wish some odd visitor had also shed a tear or two over the picture of my anguish i don t remember if these were the exact words of the poem as i read this poem way back but nobody was able to grasp the pain depicted in that picture everyone just spoke of touching it up santosh giriji you have the same problem that gaurav has and there must be crores of students like you you have the burden on yourself of fulfilling the expectations of millions of others all that i would like to say to you is that in such a situation don t lose your balance everyone expresses their expectations just keep listening but stick to your point and make an effort to do something even better but if you are not satisfied over what you have got you will never be able to create something new the strong foundation of one success becomes the foundation for another greater success the dissatisfaction arising out of success never becomes a ladder to success it guarantees failure and so i would like to appeal that you should sing in celebration of the success that you have achieved possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier i would like to appeal to parents friends and neighbours that please don t impose your expectations upon your children and friends does our life come to a standstill if we meet with failure sometimes sometimes one is not able to score good marks in exams but he or she surges ahead in sports or does well in music or excels in the fine arts or forges ahead in business god has gifted each one of us with a unique talent please recognize your internal strength build upon it and you will be able to march ahead and this happens everywhere in life you must have heard of the musical instrument called santoor there was a time when the santoor was associated with the folk music of the kashmir valley but it was pandit shiv kumar sharma whose magical touch transformed it into one of the prime musical instruments of the world shehnai once had a limited space in the world of music it was mostly played at the threshold of the courts of emperors and kings but ustad bismillah khan s mastery over the shehnai made it one of the finest musical instruments in the world it has now carved an identity of its own and so you should stop worrying about what you have and how is that just concentrate on what you have and devote your utmost with that you are sure to reap handsome rewards my dear countrymen sometimes i notice that the money that our poor families have to spend on their healthcare throws their life off the track it is true that while one has to spend little on preventing illness the expenditure incurred on regaining health after you have fallen ill is a lot more why can t we lead life in such a way that we don t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family cleanliness is one of the strongest protections from disease the greatest service that can be rendered to the poor is by maintaining cleanliness and the second thing that i constantly urge you to do is yog some people also

23-Feb-20,"On May 22, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation in his radio program, 'Mann Ki Baat.' During this broadcast, he covered several critical topics.

He began by expressing his eagerness to connect with the people and how 'Mann Ki Baat' has enabled him to do so. He noted that he was grateful for the feedback he received from citizens through various means, which helps in the government's functioning.

The speech commenced with a discussion about the severe summer heat and concerns about the delayed monsoon. PM Modi highlighted the dire environmental issues due to diminishing forest cover and forest fires in several states. He emphasized the importance of preserving flora, fauna, water, and expanding forest cover.

The address continued with PM Modi sharing his extensive discussions with the Chief Ministers of drought-affected states. Instead of holding a collective meeting, he held one-on-one meetings to address each state's unique issues, emphasizing the need for finding permanent solutions for water management.

He talked about the positive efforts made by some states in terms of water conservation and irrigation techniques. He praised states like Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh for their effective use of technology and encouraged other states to adopt similar approaches.

PM Modi called for a nationwide campaign to save water and make it a priority. He suggested using June, July, August, and September to focus on water conservation and emphasized that water is a valuable gift from God.

The speech also covered the promotion of a cashless society, with the Prime Minister advocating the use of technology for financial transactions and emphasizing the benefits of digital payments.

PM Modi urged the nation to support Indian athletes participating in the Rio Olympics and create a positive atmosphere for them.

He addressed academic achievements, mentioning the pressure students face due to high expectations and the need for parents and society to appreciate and celebrate students' accomplishments, emphasizing that every achievement should be valued.

The Prime Minister highlighted the importance of yoga and encouraged people to practice yoga regularly. He mentioned International Yoga Day on June 21 and called on citizens to participate in this global celebration of yoga.

Finally, PM Modi made it easier for people to access 'Mann Ki Baat' by providing a four-digit number (1922) for a missed call service to listen to the program at their convenience.

The speech concluded with a call to action, highlighting the significance of maintaining health and the importance of water conservation in India.",23-feb-2020 my dear countrymen i am fortunate to

substance to this opportunity making it more useful while discussing the cop convention with you an important piece of information connected with meghalaya drew my attention very recently biologists have discovered a new species of fish whose habitat is within the caves of meghalaya it is believed that this fish is the largest among aquatic species found under the surface of caves it lives in deep dark underground caves with little chance of light reaching in scientists are perplexed at the ability of this large fish to survive in such deep caves it is a matter of joy that our india and especially meghalaya is home to a rare species it lends a new facet to india s bio diversity we are surrounded by many such mysteries which are still undiscovered to discover such a phenomenal enigma calls for fierce detective passion the great tamil poetess avvaiyar writes kattat kemaavoon kalladaru udgadvu kaddat kamiyan adva kalladar olaaadu this means what we know is but just a handful of sand what we do not know is like a universe in itself similar is the case with the biodiversity of this country the more you know the more you realize the magnitude of what you do not know our biodiversity

science technology record satellite launches into space new records new missions fills up every indian heart with a sense of pride when i was in bengaluru during chandrayan 2 i witnessed immense enthusiasm fervor on the part of the children present there there was no sign of drowsiness from any angle in a way they kept awake throughout the night one can never forget their inquisitiveness when it came to science technology and innovation to give a fillip to this very enthusiasm in children young people to encourage scientific temper in them another system has been put in place you can now

paras from dhanbad jharkhand on namo app paras wants me to tell our young friends about isro s yuvika programme yuvika is a very commendable effort on part of isro to integrate the youth with science this program was launched for school students in the year 2019 yuvika is an acronym for yuva vigyani karyakram and this program is in consonance with our vision jai jawan jai kisan jai vigyan jai anusandhaan in this programme students after their exams during their holidays visit different centres of isro and learn about space technology space science and space applications if you want to know how training is imparted what its nuances are how exciting it is then you must read the experience of those who have attended its earlier sessions if you wish to be a participant of this training you can register by visiting the website of yuvika linked to that of isro my young friends i m telling you the name of the website which you can write down and must visit today itself it is have you written it down my dear countrymen the beautiful valleys of ladakh witnessed a momentous event on the 31st of january 2020 for history was made when an indian air force an 32 aircraft took off from leh s kushok bakula rimpoche airport a mixture of 10 indian bio jet fuel was used in this flight and this was the first time that this mix was used in both engines not just that but the airport from which this plane took off from leh is not only one of the highest altitude airports in india but also in the world notably the bio jet fuel is prepared from non edible tree borne oil it is procured from various tribal areas of india these efforts will not only reduce carbon emissions but may also reduce india s dependence on crude oil imports i congratulate all the people involved in this significant mission especially the scientists of csir and indian institute of petroleum dehradun who made it possible to develop the technology to fly an aircraft with bio fuel their efforts also empower the make in india mission my dear countrymen our new india is not willing to tag along with the old approach in particular our sisters and mothers of new india are going ahead and grasping the challenges hands on thus setting a pace for a positive transformation in the entire society the region of purnia in bihar is an inspiration for people across the country this area has been grappling with the havoc caused by floods for decades together in this backdrop it has been very difficult to do farming and mobilize other sources of income but under these very circumstances some women of purnia chose a different path friends earlier the women of purnia used to cultivate cocoons from silkworms obtained from mulberry trees and received very nominal price for their produce while merchants who bought this raw silk made huge profits by spinning it into silk yarn but today the women of purnia have taken a new initiative that has changed the entire scenario these women formed mulberry production co operatives with assistance from the government after that they spun silk yarn from the cocoons and also started getting saris made with those threads you will be surprised to know that the very cocoons were sold for a nominal amount earlier saris made from them are fetching thousands of rupees now the didis of the adarsh jeevika mahila mulberry production group have performed miracles that are being witnessed across many villages the farmer didis of many villages of purnia are not only getting saris produced but are also selling them in big fairs by putting up their own stalls an example of how today s women fortified with new power new thinking are achieving new targets my dear countrymen the entrepreneurship of women and daughters of our country their courage are a matter of pride for each one of us we find many such examples around us which illustrate the manner in which our daughters are breaking age old shackles and attaining new heights i would particularly like to share with you the achievement of twelve year old daughter kamya karthikeyan kamya at the age of just twelve years has conquered mount aconcagua this is the highest peak of the andes mountains in south america which is about 7000 meters high every indian will be touched by the fact that at the beginning of this month when kamya conquered the peak the first thing she did was to hoist our tricolour there i have also been told that kamya who has made the country proud is now on a new mission which is called mission saahas under this she is trying to conquer the highest peaks of all the continents also under this mission she will also be skiing on north and south poles i wish kamya all the best for mission saahas by the way kamya s achievement also motivates everyone of us to stay fit fitness has also contributed in great measure in kamya s achieving great heights at such a young age a nation that is fit will always be a nation that is a hit by the way the oncoming months are very opportune for adventure sports the geography of india is such that it provides many opportunities for adventure sports in our country on the one hand we have high mountains on the other there is a desert spread far and wide similarly on the one hand we have a network of dense forests on the other there is an infinite expanse of the sea therefore i make a special appeal to all of you to visit the place of your choice pick up the activity of your interest and ensure integrating of your life with adventure shouldn t there always be adventure in life and on top of that friends after knowing the success story of our twelve year old daughter kamya you will be astonished once you hear the success story of 105 year old bhagirathi amma friends if we wish to progress in life develop ourselves wish to achieve something in life the first pre condition for that is the student within us must never die our 105 year old bhagirathi amma also gives us this inspiration now you would be wondering who bhagirathi amma is bhagirathi amma lives in kollam in kerala she lost her mother when she was very young soon after her marriage at a young age she lost her husband as well but bhagirathi amma did not let go of her courage did not lose her spirit she had to quit school before she was 10 years old she restarted her school education at the age of 105 she started studying again in spite of her advanced age bhagirathi amma wrote her level 4 exam and then eagerly awaited her results she scored 75 percent in her exams not just that she scored cent per cent marks in mathematics amma now wants to continue her studies wants to appear for higher exams it s obvious that people like bhagirathi amma are the strength of this country a great source of inspiration for all of us today i specially salute bhagirathi amma friends our courage our determination during adverse circumstances in life can help us completely alter the situation recently i read one such story in the media which i would surely like to share with you this is the story of salman who lives in hamirpur village of moradabad salman is divyang by birth he is unable to stand on his feet despite this hardship he hasn t lost hope and decided to start his own business on top of that he resolved to help other divyang people people too and soon enough salman started manufacturing slippers and detergent in his village itself and in no time 30 divyang people joined him do also note that while salman himself found it difficult to walk he decided to manufacture slippers that help others walk easily the important thing is that salman trained his divyang colleagues himself now all of them jointly not only manufacture the products but also market them by dint of their hard work they not only ensured employment for themselves but also turned their venture into a profit making one today all of them together manufacture 150 pairs of slippers a day not just that this year salman has resolved to provide employment to 100 more such divyang mates i salute their courage and their enterprise a similar determination has been manifested by residents of ajrak village in kutch area of gujarat in 2001 after the devastating earthquake most villagers were migrating from the village however one person by the name of ismail khatri decided to stay back and nurture his traditional art form of ajrak print and in no time at all everyone was enchanted by the natural colours used in the ajrak art and the entire village joined in on their traditional handicraft category the villagers not only nurtured their ages old art form but also fused it with modern fashion now major designers and design institutions have started using the ajrak print the hardworking village folk have today turned ajrak print into a major brand large international buyers are now getting attracted towards this print my dear countrymen recently the festival of maha shivaratri was celebrated throughout the country the blessings of lord shiva and mother parvati has kept the ethos of this nation awakened on the occasion of mahashivaratri may you continue to be blessed by bhole baba may lord shiva fulfill all your

24-Apr-16,"On April 24, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a radio address to the nation. He acknowledged the ongoing summer season and the nation's cravings for mangoes, emphasizing the concerns about the sweltering heat and drought. He commended the efforts of citizens and villages in water conservation, citing examples from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

The Prime Minister also discussed the importance of quality education and the need for education reforms. He called on parents and guardians to be more involved in their children's education and advocated for a shift from a focus on enrollment to a focus on learning outcomes.

PM Modi highlighted the role of youth organizations like NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, and encouraged youth to actively participate in these organizations for holistic development.

The voluntary surrender of gas subsidies by one crore families was praised as a unique and exemplary act, which would enable one crore poor families to receive gas cylinders. This act reflected the power of trust in the people.

He called for promoting positive news and suggested a photo competition during the Kumbh Mela, with a focus on cleanliness and social values. PM Modi highlighted the Kumbh Mela's significance and potential to become a tourist attraction.

The address concluded with a call for water conservation and the spread of social values during the Kumbh Mela, highlighting the importance of trust in people and their positive actions.",24-apr-2016 my dear fellow citizens namaskar it s summer everybody makes plans for their summer holidays since this is the season of mangoes we crave for the flavour and taste of this fruit sometimes we feel a nap in the afternoon would be nice but this year the sweltering heat has spoilt the fun for everybody it is quite natural for the nation to feel concerned about the unrelenting heat on top of it due to continuous drought over the past couple of years the usual water storage facilities have been adversely affected sometimes due to encroachment sometimes due to silting the inflow of water into reservoirs and other water bodies gets blocked as a result the reservoirs store much less water than their capacity worse because of this cycle that has been going on for years the capacity itself of these reservoirs is gradually reduced to cope with the drought and to provide relief from the water crisis governments are making efforts but that s not all i have noticed that citizens are doing commendable work to help deal with the situation awareness is now seen in many villages only those who have faced shortage of water know the real value of water hence in such places they are very sensitive about water and are equally active in doing something to deal with the shortage of water i was recently told that in ahmednagar district of maharashtra the hivrebazaar gram panchayat and its villagers have addressed the problem of water shortage by treating it as a major and delicate issue one can find many villages where there is a desire to store water at hivrebazaar the farmers tackled the issue by changing the cropping pattern they have decided to give up cultivation of those crops that require a lot of water like sugarcane and banana it sounds very simple but in reality it is not so what a big collective decision this must have been if one tells the owners of factories that consume a lot of water about the consequences of this consumption and requests them to shut down their units one can well imagine what the response would be but see the sensibility of these farmer brothers when they realised that the cultivation of the sugarcane should be given up because it consumed a lot of water they went ahead and did it instead of sugarcane they have taken to such crops like fruits and vegetables that require much less water farmers in this village have taken so many initiatives such as using sprinklers drip irrigation techniques water harvesting and water recharging that today their village is strong enough to cope with the water crisis that they face i might be talking of a small place like hivrebazaar but there must be many other such villages i extend my hearty felicitations to such villagers for their fine work i was told that in devas district of madhya pradesh the gorva gram panchayat took up the drive to create farm ponds they have already created 27 farm ponds due to this there has been an increase in the ground water level whenever water was required for crops farmers had access to it this panchayat has given a rough estimate that their agricultural production has increased by 20 per cent not only has water been saved the quality of water has also vastly improved with the water level increasing world over it is said that potable water can contributing factor for gdp growth it certainly contributes to better health when the government used railways to transport water to latur it became news for the world there is no doubt that the swift manner in which indian railways has acted is praiseworthy but villagers who have taken various initiatives to save water also deserve equal amount of praise indeed i would say they deserve greater praise there are several such schemes and programmes that are run by citizens but these doesn t get our attention the good work done by the government sometimes does come to our notice if we look around us we will see that people are making an effort to combat the menace of drought by trying to find solutions that are new and innovative it is human nature that no matter how many perils people face when they hear a good news from any corner they feel as if the entire crisis is over thus ever since the day it became public knowledge that rainfall this year is expected to be between 106 and 110 it seems as if tidings of peace and happiness have come there is still some time for the monsoon to arrive but the news of good rains has already brought joy at the same time we must remember that a good monsoon offers both an opportunity and a challenge can we start a drive to save water in every village from now on itself farmers need fertile soil in their fields to grow crops this time why can t we take the soil from the bottom of ponds for our fields if we were to do this the quality of the soil in our fields would improve and the capacity of ponds to store water would increase can we fill empty cement and fertiliser bags with pebbles and sand and use them to stop water from flowing out through breaches if we were to stop water from draining out for five days for seven days it would seep into the ground and the water level would come up there would be sufficient water in our water wells thus we should strive to retain as much water as possible the water of a village will be preserved there if we work for it in a determined manner collectively therefore notwithstanding the current water scarcity and drought situation we have an opportunity during coming one and half months to prepare to harvest rainwater i have always said that people who visit porbandar the birthplace of mahatma gandhi can also see there the underground tanks constructed about 200 years ago that were built to save rain water water collected in these tanks remained pure mr kumar krishna has asked on mygov whether the cleaning of ganga will be possible while we our alive his concern is quite natural because it has been nearly 30 years since work began in this direction many governments came plans were made to clean ganga and a lot of expenditure was incurred without showing results for this reason there must be crores of indians like kumar krishna who have the same question in their hearts for those who are religiously inclined ganga is the path to salvation for them i too accept this importance of ganga but more than that ganga is the giver of life we get our daily bread from ganga we get our earnings from ganga and we get a new source of energy from ganga to live our lives the flow of ganga adds momentum to the economic pace of the country bhagirath did bring down the river ganga for us but to save it we need crores of bhagiraths the project to clean ganga cannot be successful without mass participation by the people so we all will have to become agents of change to achieve cleanliness we shall have to continuously keep on repeating this thing there are many efforts being made by the government we are seeking the full cooperation of all the states through which ganga flows we are also trying to get voluntary organisations to join us in this effort we have taken several steps for surface cleaning and to stop industrial pollution every day effluents and garbage in a large quantity flow into ganga through drains at varanasi allahabad kanpur patna trash skimmers have been deployed which clean the river while floating on it all local bodies have been given this facility and they have been urged to carry on with this work continuously and clean all the garbage from the river i have been told a few days ago that in places where this work is being carried out properly nearly 3 to 11 tonnes of garbage are being taken out of the river every day so it would be correct to say that pollutants in such a large quantity are being stopped from getting into the river in the coming days we have plans to deploy such trash skimmers at other places also and the benefits of it will be felt by the people living on the banks of ganga and yamuna to monitor and control industrial pollution an action plan has been prepared with the pulp and paper distillery and sugar industries and it has also been implemented to some extent i feel it will yield good results i am very happy that in uttarakhand and uttar pradesh where there was discharge from distilleries there has been a change for the better officers have told me that they have been successful in securing zero liquid discharge the discharge from the pulp and paper industry or the liquor industry is almost coming to an end all these things are a sign that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased i have seen that not just on the banks of ganga even in far off south if one meets a person he is sure to ask sir will ganga be cleaned this faith and hope of the common people is going to ensure success in the cleaning of ganga people are even giving donations for this thus this effort is being made quite meticulously my dear fellow citizens today is the 24th of april this is observed as panchayati raj day in india on this day the panchayati raj system was implemented in our country panchayati raj system has gradually spread to the entire country and is functioning successfully as an important unit of our democratic system of governance we celebrated 14th april as the 125th birth anniversary of babasaheb ambedekar and today we celebrate 24th april as panchayati raj day this was such a fortunate coincidence from the birth anniversary of the great man who gave us the constitution of india to 24th april the day panchayati raj was introduced in our country to empower our villages which are the strongest link of our constitution it inspired linking these two dates for this reason the government of india along with the cooperation of the state governments has launched a campaign from gram uday to bharat uday from the rise of villages to the ascent of india over the 10 day period between 14th april and 24th april it was my good fortune that on 14th april the birth anniversary of babasaheb ambedkar i got the opportunity to visit his birthplace mhow and pay my respects at that sacred place and today on 24th april i am going to jharkhand where mostly my tribal brothers and sisters stay in jharkhand i am going to celebrate panchayati raj divas at 3 in the afternoon i shall be talking to all panchayats of the country this campaign has worked in a major way to generate awareness how can the democratic institutions at the village level in every corner of india be strengthened how can the villages become self reliant how can villages plan programmes for their own development there should be due importance laid on physical and social infrastructure there should be no school dropouts in villages and the campaign to educate the girl child beti bachao beti padhao abhiyan should be successfully carried out the birth of the girl child should be celebrated in a big way there should be some plans to do that in some villages people organised food donation on this occasion it happens very rarely that so many different programmes go on at the same time in so many villages of india i congratulate all the state governments and the village heads they have gone about these programmes in a very novel way for the welfare of villages for the development of villages and for the strengthening of democracy the awareness that has come about in villages guarantees a new progress for india the foundation for the progress of india is the rise of its villages so if we all keep laying stress on the progress of the villages we shall continue to get the desired results sharmila dharpure from mumbai has expressed her concern to me through her phone call sound byte mr prime minister namaskar i am sharmila dharpure speaking from mumbai i have a question for you about the school and college education for the last so many years a strong need for reforms has been felt in the education sector either the required amount of schools and colleges are not there or else the quality in education is lacking it has been often found that the children complete their schooling but they still don t have knowledge about the most basic things and so they lag behind in this competitive world what are your views how do you wish to bring about reforms sharmilaji your concern is quite genuine today in every home the first thing that the parents dream of is to give their children good education a house a car all that comes later and for a country like india this common sentiment of the people is a very big force to educate their children and educate them well this concern for the children to get good education should increase further and a greater awareness should come about i believe that when there is awareness in the family it impacts the school and has an impact on teachers as well the child is also aware of the purpose for which he or she goes to school so i would appeal to all guardians and parents to give not just enough time and attention to their children but also to everything that s happenings in their school and if something strikes your attention please go to the school and discuss it with the teachers yourself vigilance can be of help to reduce many shortcomings in the education system people s participation will go a long way in achieving this every government in our country has laid stress on education and every government has made efforts for it in its own way it is true that for a long time our focus has been on setting up educational institutions expanding the system of education building schools building colleges recruiting teachers ensuring maximum attendance of children so priority has been given in a way to the spread of education this was necessary but today more than expanding education what is necessary is to improve the quality of education we have already done a lot towards expanding education now we will have to focus on quality education we will have to shift our priority from literacy campaign to good education till now we concentrated on the outlay for education the time has come to focus on the outcome of it till now the stress has been on how many are attending school from now onward more than schooling we will have to lay stress on learning till now we have heard the echo of the mantra of enrolment enrolment enrolment but now we will have to turn our attention to providing good education worthy education to children who have made it to schools you must have seen the budget of the present government an effort is being made to provide quality education but it is true we still have a long way to go if we 125 crore indians resolve we can cover that distance sharmila ji has rightly said that we do need to bring reforms for quality education you must have noticed in the budget that we have decided to do something unconventional in the budget we have made 10 government universities and 10 private universities free from government control and asked them to accept the challenge to flourish on their own we have asked them to come up with what they would like to do to become the best universities we have done this with the intention of giving them a free hand indian universities can also compete with world class universities and they should along with importance to education there is importance to skill likewise technology plays a very big role in education long distance education and technology will make the task of education simpler i believe that the results of this move are going to be seen in the near future since a long time people have been asking me questions on one topic some have written on my web portal mygov in others have written to me on narendramodiapp it s mostly the youth who write to me sound byte mr prime minister namaskar i am mona karnwal from bijnore for the youth in today s age along with studies sports are also of great importance they should have a feeling of team spirit and the qualities of a good leader for their overall holistic development i state this from my own experience because i have served in the bharat scouts and guides and this had a very good impact upon my life i want you to motivate the youth as much as you can and i want the government to also promote ncc nss and the bharat scouts and guides as much as possible you people have been sending me so many suggestions that one day i felt that first of all i must talk to these people it was under pressure from you people following your suggestions that i recently called for a meeting with the chiefs of ncc nss bharat scouts and guides red cross and the nehru yuva kendra i asked them if they have ever had a meeting before and they said that since independence this was the first time that they were attending a meeting like this so first i would like to felicitate my young friends who put pressure on me the result of which was that i held this meeting i felt glad that i met them i felt the need for greater coordination they are doing a lot in their own way but if work is done collectively in an organized manner then these various organizations of ours can bring about huge results they are spread so wide reaching out to so many families i saw an answer in the way they had spread far and wide and were filled with enthusiasm they had the resolve to do something it s true that i myself have been a cadet in the ncc and so i know firsthand how one acquires a fresh perspective through such organizations children draw inspiration and develops a national perspective i did get the benefit of that in my childhood i believe that we should infuse a new life a new force into these organizations this time i put some issues before them i told them that for this season why don t all these organizations and our youth make an effort for water conservation we could collectively try and stop open defecation in so many blocks and so many districts what kind of programmes can we make to unite our country can we have a common youth song for all these organizations we spoke on many issues today i appeal to you all as well please suggest the perfect ideas for these youth organizations do we need to add anything new in their functioning and their programmes if you write to me on my narendramodiapp i will send them to the right place after this meeting i feel they are going to gain a new momentum now even you will wish to join one of them my dear fellow citizens i now wish to talk about something that will compel us all to think i view it also as something that is going to shake us all you must have seen for yourself that the political situation in our country is such that in the previous elections political parties made promises of giving each household 9 to 12 gas cylinders and each political party felt that if they had to politically approach the middle class society then gas cylinder was a major issue on the other hand economists have put constant pressure to reduce the subsidy on gas cylinders for this reason many committees would sit which would receive many proposals and suggestions on the issue of lessening the gas subsidy crores of rupees would be spent on these committees but the matter would remain at a standstill this has been everybody s experience no one ever thought beyond this today my dear fellow citizens i have utmost pleasure in placing before you all my own account on this i have chosen the third way out and that is the path of placing trust and confidence in the people and the masses at times we political leaders should trust our people more than we trust ourselves we should have implicit faith in the people i had once said to you that if you can bear the expense of 1500 2000 rupees per year then why don t you give up your subsidy on gas this could be of use to poor households i had said it just like that but today i can say with confidence that i am indeed very proud of you all one crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders these one crore are not wealthy families among them are retired teachers retired clerks farmers small shopkeepers these are middle class and lower middle class families that have given up their subsidy now look at the other rather unique side of it they could have given up their subsidy through the app on their mobile going online or by giving a missed call over the telephone there were many options but it has been estimated that more than 80 of these one crore families chose to go to the distributor stand in a queue and give in writing that they wish to surrender their subsidy my dear fellow citizens this is not a small matter if the government gives even a small concession on tax or exemption from tax then for a whole week we hear praise for that government being splashed on tv channels and in newspapers here these one crore families have given up their subsidy and in our country subsidy has turned into a kind of a right that people expect a thing like that they have chosen to give up i would like to salute those one crore families i humbly bow to them because they have compelled political leaders to think of coming up with something new this has also forced the economists of the country to think differently even the global economic experts who used to live in a world of their calculations would find this phenomenon to be beyond their limits of traditional wisdom at some point of time they will also have to think of this novel experience that has defied conventional thinking one crore families giving up their subsidy on gas cylinders and in return one crore poor families getting gas cylinders with the money that is saved from the one crore families that have given up their subsidy externally it appears just an incident but its extraordinary lesson is that if you place faith in the people it leads to most handsome achievements i would like to specially appeal to the entire political class to place implicit faith in the people that will fetch such terrific results that one could have never ever imagined we should move in this direction i have always felt this way like when i felt why class 3 and class 4 employees should be made to go through interviews we should trust the person who has given the exams and submitted the marks sometimes i feel that we should publicly announce that today on this route of the railways there will be no ticket checker let s see what happens when we place faith in the people of india we can undertake several such experiments once we place faith and trust in the people of india we can get incomparable results anyway these are just some personal thoughts we cannot make these into government rules but we can certainly create that kind of an atmosphere this atmosphere has not been created by any political leader but by one crore families of india a person called ravi has written to me good news everyday he writes please ask your officials to post about one good incident every day each newspaper and news channel has bad news for its every breaking news is there not anything good happening around in this country populated by 125 crore people please change this situation ravi ji has expressed his anger but i think he is not venting his anger on me but on the prevailing conditions you may remember that the former president of india dr a p j abdul kalam used to always say please print only positive news on the front page of the newspaper he used to continuously repeat that some days back a newspaper had written a letter to me saying that they had decided that on mondays they would not give any negative news but only positive news these days i have noticed that some t v channels have begun setting aside some time for positive news so it is right to say that there is an atmosphere all around of positive news and everybody feels that the people should get the right news and good news it is true that even if the most highly placed men and women relate the best possible things in the best possible words and in the best possible manner good news has a better impact than that good news becomes the greatest reason and inspiration to do something good it is true that the more we give prominence to good things the less space there will be for bad things if we light a lamp the darkness is sure to be dispelled you all must be aware that the government has started a website transforming india on this you get news of positive happenings not just of the government but also of the people around this is a portal where even you can send news of any good thing that s happened to you you can contribute to the site raviji you have given a good suggestion but please don t get angry with me we all should strive together to do something positive talk about something positive to spread something positive there is one great speciality of our country the kumbh mela the kumbh mela can become the centre of tourist attraction as well very few know that since a long time crores and crores of people have gathered on the river banks for this festival the peaceful atmosphere at the kumbh mela gives moments of tranquillity to the soul these festivals from the point of view of organization event management and people s participation set new and high standards i have been noticing for the last two days that many people have uploaded pictures of the simhastha kumbh mela i would like the tourism department of the government of india and the state government to hold a photo competition on this occasion people should be encouraged to take the finest photographs and upload them what an atmosphere that would create people will also come to know of the myriad and different activities going on in every corner of the kumbh mela this can surely be done it s true that i met the chief minister of madhya pradesh recently and he told me that they have laid special emphasis on cleanliness it is not that the cleanliness remains confined to that place people should carry back the message of cleanliness with them i believe that even if the kumbh mela is a religious and spiritual occasion we can turn it into a social occasion we can turn it into an occasion of imbibing good values it can become a reason to carry good resolutions and good habits to all the villages we should use each kumbh mela to make people aware of how we can increase our value for water our faith in water how we can spread the message of water conservation we should do this my dear fellow citizens i will surely meet you all once in the evening on this important occasion of panchayati raj divas today my heartiest thanks to you all as always the unshakeable bond between your inner thoughts and those of mine gives me immense pleasure many thanks ,"Modi started

visited the pradhanmantri sangrahalaya at the very first opportunity the message that sarthak ji has written to me on namo app is very interesting he has written that for years he has been watching news channels reading newspapers along with being connected to social media so he used to think that his general knowledge was good enough but when he visited the pm museum he was very surprised he realized that he did not know much about his country and those who led the country he has written about certain facets of the pm museum which heightened his curiosity such as the spinning wheel of lal bahadur shastri gifted to him by his in laws that made sarthak ji happy he also saw shastri ji s passbook noticing how little savings he had sarthak ji has written that he did not even know that morarji bhai desai was deputy collector in gujarat before joining the freedom struggle he had a long career in the administrative service on chaudhary charan singh ji sarthak ji writes that he was unaware of chaudhary charan singh ji s great contribution in the field of zamindari abolition not just that he further writes he saw that mr p v narasimha rao ji took a very keen interest in the work of land reform sarthak ji also came to know only after coming to this museum that chandrashekhar ji had undertaken the historic bharat yatra walking more than 4 thousand kilometers in the museum when he saw the items that atalji used listened to his speeches he was filled with pride sarthak ji also mentioned that this museum also provides very interesting information about mahatma gandhi sardar patel dr ambedkar jai prakash narayan and our prime minister pandit jawaharlal nehru friends what can be a better time to remember the contribution of the prime ministers of the country than the azadi ka amrit mahotsav it is a matter of pride for the country that the azadi ka amrit mahotsav is taking the form of a mass movement people s interest in history is increasing a lot and in such a situation the pm museum is also becoming a centre of attraction for the youth connecting them with the precious heritage of the country by the way friends when so much is being discussed with you

and pen what i am going to ask you right now you can share the answers on namo app or social media with museumquiz and do share i urge you to answer all these questions this will enhance interest in the museum among people all over the country do you know in which city of the country there is a famous rail museum where people have been getting a chance to see the heritage of indian railways for the last 45 years let me give you another clue you can also find here from the fairy queen the saloon of prince of wales to the fireless steam locomotive do you know which museum is there in mumbai

only kite museum let me give you a clue the biggest kite displayed here is 22 by 16 feet in size did something come to mind no let me tell you one more thing here the city in which it is located has a special connection with bapu who does not have the hobby of collecting postage stamps in childhood but do you know where the national museum related to postage stamps is in india i ask you one more question which museum is housed in a building named gulshan mahal the clue for you is that in this museum you can also become the director of a film you can also see the nuances of camera editing ok do you know of any museum that celebrates india s textile heritage this museum has miniature paintings jaina manuscripts sculptures many more it is also known for its unique display friends in this era of technology it is very easy for you to find answers to these i asked these questions so that the curiosity in our new generation rises they read more about them go and visit them now because of the importance of museums many people themselves are coming forward and donating a lot to the museums many people are donating their old collections as well as historical artefacts to museums when you do this in a way you share a cultural treasure with the entire society in india too people are now coming forward for this i also appreciate all such individual efforts today in the changing times and due to the covid protocols emphasis is being placed on adopting new methods in museums the focus has also increased on digitization in museums you must be aware that on the 18th of mayinternational museum day will be celebrated all over the world in view of this i have an idea for my young friends why not visit a local museum with your circle of friends during the upcoming holidays do share your experience with museummemories by doing so you will also awaken curiosity about museums in the minds of others my dear countrymen you must be taking many resolves in your life and be you must be working hard to fulfill them friends recently i came to know about such a resolve which was really different very unique that s why i thought that i must share it with the listeners of mann ki baat friends can you imagine that someone could come out of one s house with a resolve that one would roam the whole city for the whole day without doing any money transaction in cash isn t this an interesting resolve two daughters of delhi sagarika and preksha experimented with cashless day outlike this wherever sagarika and preksha went in delhi they got the facility of digital payment because of the upi qr code they did not have to withdraw cash even at most of the street food and roadside vendors they got the facility of online transaction friends one may think that it is delhi a metro city it is easy to have all this here but now it is not the case that this spread of upi is limited only to big cities like delhi i have also received a message from anandita tripathi from ghaziabad anandita had gone to the north east with her husband last week she narrated me the experience of her journey from assam to meghalaya and tawang in arunachal pradesh you will also be pleasantly surprised to know that in this journey of spanning several days they did not need to withdraw cash even in remote areas in places where there was no good internet facility till a few years ago now there is also the facility of payment through upi looking at the experiences of sagarika preksha and anandita i would also urge you to try the experiment of cashless day out definitely do it friends in the last few years bhim upi has rapidly become a part of our economy and habits now even in small towns and in most villages people are transacting through upi itself a culture is also evolving in the country throughs digital economy in the small street shops digital paymenthas made it easy to serve more and more customers now they don t even have a problem of loose change you must also feel the convenience of upi in everyday life wherever you go carrying cash going to the bank finding an atm the hassle is now over all payments are made from mobile itself but have you ever thought that how big a digital economy has been created in the country due to these small online payments of yours at present transactions worth about 20 thousand crore rupees are taking place in our country every day last march upi transactions reached around rs 10 lakh crores due to this convenience is also increasing in the country and an atmosphere of honesty is also being created now many new start ups related to fin tech are also coming up in the country i would like you to share any experiences related to this power of digital payment and start up ecosystem your experiences can become an inspiration to many other countrymen my dear countrymen how the power of technology is changing the lives of ordinary people we are constantly seeing this around us technology has done another great job it has served to bring the benefit of the extraordinary abilities of the divyang friends to the country and the world at the tokyo paralympics we have seen what our divyang brothers and sisters can achieve just like in sports in arts academics and many other fields divyang friends are doing wonders but when these friends get the power of technology they achieve even greater heights that is why the country is constantly making efforts to make the resources and infrastructure accessible to the differently abled there are also many start ups and organizations in the country which are doing inspirational work in this direction there is one such organization voice of specially abled people this organization is promoting new opportunities in the field of assistive technology an innovative beginning has also been made to take the work of divyang artists to the world voice of specially abled people has prepared a digital art gallery of paintings of these artists how divyang friends are rich in extraordinary talents and what extraordinary abilities they have this art gallery is an example of that what are the challenges in the life of divyang friends how far can they reach after overcoming them you can feel many such facets in these paintings if you also know a divyang friend know their talent then with the help of digital technology you can bring them to the fore in front of the world divyang friends must also join such endeavours my dear countrymen summer heat is increasing very fast in most parts of the country this rising heat equally increases our responsibility to save water it is possible that there may be plenty of water available where you are now but you also have to always remember the crores of people who live in water stressed areas for whom every drop of water is like elixir friends at this time in the 75th year of independence in the azadi ka amrit mahotsav water conservation is one of the resolves with which the country is moving forward during the amrit mahotsav 75 amrit sarovars will be built in every district of the country you can imagine how big the campaign is the day is not far when there will be 75 amrit sarovars in your own city i would like all of you and especially the youth to know about this campaign and also bear responsibility for it if there is any history related to freedom struggle in your area if there is a memory of a freedom fighter you can also connect it with amrit sarovar by the way i like to learnthat after taking the resolve of amrit sarovar work has started on it at many places at a rapid pace i have come to know about gram panchayat patwai of rampur in up there was a pond on the land of the gram sabha but it was full of filth and heaps of garbage with a lot of hard work with the help of local people with the help of local school children that dirty pond has been transformed in the last few weeks now many arrangements have been made on the banks of that lake like retaining wall boundary wall food court fountains and lighting i congratulate the patwai gram panchayat of rampur the people of the village the children there for this effort friends the availability of water and the scarcity of water these determine the progress and speed of any country you must have also noticed that in mann ki baat i do talk about water conservation again and again along with topics like cleanliness it is clearly stated in our scriptures paniyam paramam loke jeevaanaam jeevanam samritam that is in the world water is the basis of life of every living being and water is also the biggest resource that is why our ancestors gave so much emphasis on water conservation from vedas to puranas to save water everywhere to build ponds lakes etc has been termed as the social and spiritual duty of a person in valmiki ramayana special emphasis has been laid on water conservation on connecting water sources similarly students of history would know how much engineering was developed in india regarding water even during the indus saraswati and harappan civilizations in ancient times there was an interconnected system of water sources in many cities and this was the time when the population was not that much there was no shortage of natural resources there was a kind of abundance yet about water conservation the awareness was very high then but today the situation is reverse i urge all of you to know about such old ponds wells and lakes in your area due to the amrit sarovar abhiyan along with water conservation a distinct identity of your area will also develop with this local tourist places will also be developed in cities localities people will also get a place to walk around friends every effort related to water is related to our tomorrow it is the responsibility of the whole society for this different societies have madevarious efforts continuously for centuries for example maldhari a tribe of rann of kutch uses a method called vridas for water conservation under this small wells are built and trees and plants are planted nearby to protect it similarly the bhil tribe of madhya pradesh used their historical tradition halma for water conservation under this tradition the people of this tribe gather at one place to find a solution to the problems related to water due to the suggestions received from the halma tradition the water crisis in this area has reduced and the ground water level is also increasing friends if the same sense of duty comes in everyone s mind the biggest of challenges related to water crisis can be solved come let us take a pledge to conserve water and save life in the azadi ka amrit mahotsav of freedom we will save water drop by drop and save every single life my dear countrymen you must have seen that a few days ago i held pariksha pe charcha with my young friends and students during this discussion some students said that they are afraid of maths in the exam a similar thought was also sent to me by many students in their messages at that very moment i had decided that i would definitely discuss mathematics this time in mann ki baat friends mathematics is such a subject about which we indians should be most comfortable after all the people of india have given the most research and contribution to the whole world regarding mathematics you must have heard a lot about zero that is the discovery of zero and its importance often you will also hear that if zero was not discovered then perhaps we would not have been able to see so much scientific progress in the world from calculus to computers all these scientific inventions are based on zero mathematicians and scholars of india have even written that that is whatever is there in this entire universe everything is based on mathematics if you remember the study of science you will understand its meaning every principle of science is expressed through a mathematical formula be it newton s laws einstein s famous equation all the science related to the universe is mathematics now scientists also discuss theory of everything that is a single formula that can express everything in the universe our sages have always imagined such an expansion of scientific understanding with the help of mathematics if we invented zero we have also expressed infinityas well in common parlance when we talk about numbers and numbers we speak and think till million billion and trillion but in vedas and in indian mathematics this calculation goes much further we have a very old verse here the order of numbers is given in this verse such as one ten hundred thousand and ayut lakh niyut and koti i e crores similarly this number goes up to the shankh padma and saagar one saagar means 10 to the power of 57 not only this there are numbers like ogh and mahog even after this there is a mahogha 10 to the power of 62 that is 62 zeros next to one even if we imagine such a large number in the mind it is difficult but in indian mathematics they have been used for thousands of years just a few days ago i met the ceo of intel company he had given me a painting in which one such indian method of calculation or measurement was depicted through vamana avatar with reference to the name intel the computer would have come automatically to your mind you must have also heard about the binary system in the language of computer butdo you know that in our country there were sages like acharya pingala who postulated the binary similarly from mathematicians aryabhatta to ramanujan there has been work on many principles of mathematics here friends mathematics has never been a difficult subject for us indians a big reason for this is our vedic mathematics the credit of vedic mathematics in modern times goes to shri bharati krishna tirtha ji maharaj he revived the ancient methods of calculation and named it vedic mathematics the most important thing about vedic mathematics was that through it you can do even the most difficult calculations in your mind in the blink of an eye you must have seen videos of many such youths learning and teaching vedic maths on social media these days friends today in mann ki baat a similar friend who teaches vedic mathematics is also joining us this is gaurav tekriwal ji of kolkata and for the last two and a half decades he has been taking this movement of vedic mathematics forward with great dedication come let s talk to him modi ji gaurav ji namaste gaurav namaste sir modi ji i have heard that you are very interested in vedic maths you do a lot so first i would like to know something about you and later how you are interested in this subject do tell me gaurav sir when i was applying for business school twenty years ago it used to have a competitive exam called cat there were many maths questions in it which had to be done in little time so my mother brought me a book called vedic mathematics swami shri bharatikrishna tirtha ji maharaj had written that book and in that he gave 16 sutras in which mathematics used to be very simple and very fast when i read that i was very inspired and then my interest was awakened in mathematics i understood that this subject which is a gift of india which is our heritage can be taken to every corner of the world since then i made it a mission to take vedic mathematics to every nook and corner of the world because the fear of mathematics haunts everyone and what can be simpler than vedic mathematics modi ji gaurav ji for how many years have you been working in this gaurav it has been almost 20 years sir i am still at it modi ji and what do you do for awareness what experiments do you use how do you reach people gaurav we go to schools we give online education the name of our organization is vedic maths forum india under that organization we teach vedic maths 24 hours a day through the internet sir modi ji gaurav ji you know i also like to interact with children constantly and i keep looking for opportunities and with exam warrior i have institutionalized it in a way and i have also experienced that when i talk to children they run away as soon as they hear the name of maths and so my effort is that this fear which is without any reason should be removed this fear should be removed withbasic techniques of mathematics which come from our traditions and which are not new to india perhaps among the ancient traditions in the world india has a tradition of mathematics soif the exam warrior s fear has to be dispelled what will you advise them gaurav sir this is most useful for children because the fear of exams which has become a fobia in every home children take tuition for the exam parents are worried teachers also get upset so all this gets dissipates with vedic maths vedic maths is fifteen hundred percent faster than this simple maths and it gives a lot of confidence in the children and the mind also runs faster as such we have also introduced yoga with vedic mathematics so that if the children want they can calculate even with their eyes closed by the method of vedic mathematics modi ji even in the tradition of dhyan doing mathematics in this way is also a primary course of meditation gaurav right sir modi ji well gaurav ji it is very nice that you and i have taken up this work in mission mode and especially your mother took you on this path as a good guru and today you are taking millions of children on that path my best wishes to you gaurav thank you sir i thank you sir that you gave importance to vedic maths and chose me sir so we are very thankful modi ji thank you very much namaskar gaurav namaste sir friends gaurav ji has very well explained how vedic maths can transform mathematicsfrom complex to fun not only this you can also solve big scientific problems with vedic mathematics i would like all parents to teach vedic maths to their children with this their confidence will not only increase the analytical power of their brain will also increase and yes whatever little fear some children have about mathematics that phobia will also end completely my dear countrymen today in mann ki baat many informative topics from museum to maths were discussed all these topics become part of mann ki baat only because of your

24-Feb-19,"In the Mann Ki Baat broadcast on February 24, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation with a heavy heart, lamenting the loss of brave Indian soldiers in the Pulwama terror attack just ten days prior. He praised their sacrifice and resilience, emphasizing the nation's collective grief and anger over this tragic event.

Prime Minister Modi highlighted the courage of the soldiers and their families, sharing inspiring stories from their loved ones, such as the father willing to send another son to join the armed forces and the wife who pledged to send her son to the CRPF. The whole nation saluted these courageous families who exemplified the spirit of patriotism, sacrifice, and perseverance.

The Prime Minister also announced the completion of the National War Memorial, symbolizing India's gratitude to its soldiers who laid down their lives after independence. This memorial, located in Delhi, is dedicated to the memory of these brave soldiers and reflects their indomitable courage.

In the latter part of the address, Prime Minister Modi acknowledged the upcoming board examinations in schools, offering his best wishes to the students and emphasizing the importance of exams in a student's life. He discussed the Pariksha Pe Charcha event, which provided a platform for students and parents to interact and discuss various aspects of examinations.

The speech also featured stories of individuals who received Padma awards for their extraordinary contributions in diverse fields, especially those who selflessly worked at the grassroots level to bring about positive changes in society.

Finally, Prime Minister Modi extended his best wishes for Mahashivratri and shared a heartwarming anecdote about a visually challenged artist who could imitate him, illustrating the reach and impact of Mann Ki Baat. He concluded by expressing his gratitude to the listeners and announced that the next episode of Mann Ki Baat would air after the general elections.",24-feb-2019 my dear countrymen namaskar i begin mann ki baat today with a heavy heart 10 days ago mother india had to bear the loss of many of her valiant sons these brave hearts made the supreme sacrifice in securing the lives of a hundred twenty five crore indians in order to ensure that their fellow countrymen could sleep peacefully these brave sons toiled relentlessly day or night as a consequence of the pulwama terror attack and the sacrifice of the brave jawans people across the country are agonized and enraged all around there is a deluge of strong feelings of sympathy for the martyrs their family members the outrage that singes your being and mine on account of the terrorizing violence replicates itself in the collective inner psyche of every citizen of the country it also echoes in pro humanity communities of the world which sincerely believe in humanity i respectfully bow to all the brave sons of the country who laid down their lives protecting the honour of their motherland india this martyrdom will keep inspiring us relentlessly to uproot the very base of terrorism it will fortify our resolve we shall have to take up this challenge facing our country forgetting all barriers of casteism communalism regionalism and other difference so that our steps against terror are firmer stronger and more decisive our armed forces have consistently displayed unparalleled courage and valour on the one hand they have displayed exemplary capabilities in restoring peace on the other they have retaliated in equal measure in a language the attackers understand you must have seen how within a hundred hours of the attack retributive action was accomplished the army has resolved to wipe out terrorists and their harbourers the martyrdom of these brave soldiers brought to the fore through the media touching inspiring stories of their kin whichgive hope and strength to the entire country the fortitude displayed by ram niranjanji father of martyr ratan thakur of bhagalpur bihar in this moment of tribulation is truly inspiring he has expressed the wish of sending his second son too to take on the enemy if need be he himself would go and fight the country salutes the indomitable courage of meenaji wife of martyr prasannasahu of jagatsinghpur odisha she has vowed to send her only son to join the crpf when the mortal remains of martyr vijay soren draped in the tricolor reached gumla jharkhand his innocent son iterated that he too would join the armed forces the mettle of this innocent lad is a representative sample of the feelings of each every child of the nation today similar sentiments are coming to the fore in the households of our brave heart martyrs no martyr no family is an exception to that whether it be the family of martyr vijay maurya of devariya the parents of martyr tilakraj of kangra or the six year old son of martyr hemraj of kota the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration i urge the young generation to know and understand the fortitude and the sentiment displayed by these families to understand the virtues of patriotism sacrifice and perseverance one doesn t need to revert to historical events these are but living examples before your eyes these very examples are a source of inspiration for the future of a rising glowing india my dear countrymen the rather long wait after independence for a war memorial is about to be over it is natural for our countrymen to be curious about it on the narendra modi app shri onkar shetty ji of udupi karnataka has expressed his happiness on the completion of the national war memorial india not having a national war memorial used to surprise me pain me a memorial that would house the valour saga series of our brave soldiers who laid down their lives safe guarding their nation s security and i took a resolve that the country must have such a memorial we decided to erect the national war memorial and i am contented to see it attaining completion in so little a time tomorrow that is on the 25th of february crores of we indians will dedicate this national soldiers memorial to our armed forces on part of the nation this will be a small step towards repaying a great debt this new memorial has been instituted in the heart of delhi in close vicinity of india gate and amar jawanjyoti i do believe that for our countrymen a visit to the national war memorial will be akin to a pilgrimage to a holy place the national soldiers memorial is a symbol of the nation s gratitude to those men who made the supreme sacrifice after we gained independence the memorial s design symbolises the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers the concept of the national soldiers memorial is based on the notion of four concentric circles which depicts the journey of a soldier from coming into being culminating in his martyrdom the flame of the amar chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier the second circle veerta chakra depicts the courage and bravery of our soldiers it is a gallery whose walls are inscribed with soldiers tales of valour this is followed by the tyag chakra this circle stands for the sacrifice of our soldiers this bears the names of soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice in letters of gold following that is the rakshak chakra which depicts the spirit of security this circle houses a row of dense trees these trees represent soldiers and send a reassuring message to the country s citizens that our soldiers vigilantly guard borders round the clock and that they the citizens are safe if you take a holistic view the national soldiers memorial is sure to turn out to be a sacred site where people will throng to get information on our great martyrs to express their gratitude to conduct further research on them this place stands testimony to a series of sacrifices of men who laid down their lives for the sake of their country so that we could live so that the country could be safe secure paving the way for development one falls short of words in assessing the enormous contribution of our armed forces police and para military forces in the strides of progress achieved by the country in the month of octoberlast year i was blessed with the opportunity to dedicate the national police memorial to the nation that too echoed the same sentiment and we believe that we should be ever grateful to those policemen police women who relentlessly ensure our safety security i do hope that you will pay a visit to the national soldiers memorial and the national police memorial whenever you are there do capture images and share them on social media so that others get inspired to come visit this sacred site with eagerness my dear countrymen for mann ki baat i keep getting thousands of letters and comments from your side on various platforms once while i was going through your comments i came across an interesting point by atishmukhopadhyayji he has written that on the 3rd of march 1900 the british arrested birsamunda when he was just 25 years old coincidentally the 3rd of march is also the birth anniversary of jamsetji tata he further states that despite both personalities hailing from diverse family backgrounds they enriched the legacy and the history of jharkhand paying tributes to birsamunda and jamsetji tata is in a way salutation to the glorious legacy and history of jharkhand these two distinguished personalities brought glory honour not just to jharkhand but the entire country the country is indeed grateful for their contribution today if an inspiring personality is required for ably guiding our youth it certainly is that of bhagwanbirsamunda the british tree treacherously arrested him when he was asleep in a covert manner do you know why they had to resort to such a cowardly operation because even the british who raised a mighty empire used to be terrified of him bhagwanbirsamunda took on the might of the guns cannons of the british using traditional bows and arrows to shake them apart the fact is when people are blessed with exemplary leadership the might of arms pales in comparison to the collective will power of the people bhagwanbirsamunda not only waged a struggle against the british for political freedom he also actively fought for the social economic rights of the tribal folk and he accomplished all this in his rather short life he let sunshine peep into the darkened lives of the deprived and the oppressed bhagwanbirsamunda sacrificed his life at the tender age of twenty five illustrious sons of mother india such as birsamunda have come into being in each every part of the country there must ve been hardly any part of india which did not produce someone who contributed in the long freedom struggle that spanned centuries but it s a misfortune that these tales of valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generations if the valourousbhagwanbirsamunda made us aware of our existence identity far sightedjamsetji tata created great institutions for the country jamsetji tata was a true visionary who not only foresaw india s future but also duly laid strong foundations he knew very well that making india a hub of science technology and industry was imperative for her future it was his vision that culminated in the establishment of the tata institute of science which we know as indian institute of science today not just that he also established world renowned institutions and industries such as tata steel on a voyage to america jamsetji tata met swami vivekananda on the ship and an important topic of their discussion was the outreach spread of science technology in india it is said this very discussion led to the founding of the indian institute of science my dear countrymen our former prime minister morarji desai was born on the 29th of february all of you know that this day comes just once in four years a simple peace loving personality morarjibhai was one of the most disciplined leaders in independent india the record of presenting the budget the maximum number of times is held by morarjibhai desai morarji desai steered the course of the country through some difficult times when the very democratic fabric of the country was under a threat to save democracy morarji desai flung himself in the movement against imposition of emergency for this he had to pay a heavy price in his old age the government of that time arrested and incarcerated him but when the janata party won the general elections in 1977 he became the prime minister of the country during his tenure the 44th constitutional amendment was introduced this was important because the 42nd amendment which was brought during the emergency curtailed the powers of the supreme court and implemented provisions which stood to violate our democratic values was struck down the 44th amendment made it mandatory that the proceedings of parliament and legislative assemblies were made public through the newspapers this amendment restored certain powers of supreme court and declared that the fundamental rights granted under article 20 and 21 of the constitution could not be abrogated during the emergency for the first time constitutional safeguards guaranteed that the president could only announce the emergency upon the written recommendation of the cabinet and that the period of emergency could not be extended more than six months at any stretch of time in this way morarji bhai ensured that the way democracy was assassinated in 1975 by imposition of emergency could never be repeated againin the future theupcoming generations of our nation will always remember his priceless contribution in maintaining the sanctity of indian democracy once again i pay my homage to a great leader like him my beloved countrymen this year too there was a great buzz about the padma award today as we head towards a new india in which we want to honour those who are doing their work at the grass root level without any care for a reward they by their diligence are powering positive changes in the lives of others in myriad ways in reality they are true karmyogis who are selflessly engaged in public service social service and above all in the service to the nation you must have been a witness yourself to the curiosity in the air when the padma awards are announced and people are inquisitive about the awardees in a way i consider this to be a huge pat on the back because these are people who are not on the front page of a magazine or newspaper or on our tv screens they are far removed from the world of glitter and glare and are people who do not care about name or fame but simply believe in toiling at the proletarian level theybelieve in living in the manner as preached by the shloka of srimadbhagvad gita yoga karmasukaushalam or excellence in action is yoga i would like to tell you about some of these people you must have heard about odisha s daitarinayak who is not nicknamed the canal man of odisha for nothing daitarinayakchiselled through the mountain literally with his hands and carved a three kilometers long canal in his village and put to restforever the problem of irrigation and water by the sheer dint of his labour take the case of abdul ghafoor khatri of gujarat whohas done an amazing job of reviving the traditional rogan painting form of kutch he is doing a great job of extending this rare painting art form to the present generation i had gifted a roganpainting titled tree of life done by abdul gafoor to the former president of usa mr barack obama among the recipients of the padma award shabbirsayyed of marathwada is known as the servant of gau mata the manner he has spent his entire life in the service of gau mata is unique in itself madurai chinna pillai is the same person who at first tried to

tarzan in jharkhand most valiantly took on the timber mafia and naxalites and not only saved the 50 hectares of forest but also inspired ten thousand women to unite and protect the trees and wildlife it is a tribute to jamunaji s diligence that today on the birth of every child villagersplant 18 trees also 10 trees are planted on the marriage of a girl in the village the story of muktabenpankajkumardagali of gujarat will fill you with inspiration despite being a divyang herself it is difficult to find an example than what muktaben did for the upliftment of divyang women by establishing the institution named chakshumahilasevakunj through the medium of which she has been engaged in a virtuousendeavour to make visually challenged children self reliant the story of kisanchachi i e farmer aunty of muzaffarpur in bihar or rajkumari devi is very inspiring she has established a precedent in the direction of women empowerment and farming rajkumari deviadded 300 women of her area to a self help group and motivated the entire lot become financially self reliant she not only trained the women of the village in pursuing other gainful means of employment but most importantly she integrated technology with agricultureand my dear countrymen it has perhaps happenedfor the first time that in the roll of padma awards bestowed this year 12 farmers have been the recipients generally very few people associated with the agricultural world or those very few who can be labeled as real farmers have ever found their name in the list of padmashree awards this in itself presents the live and vibrant image of a changing india my dear countrymen today i wish to narrate a heart rending experience with you which i ve beenwanting to do past few days at present

He emphasized the unifying power of yoga, bringing people together beyond borders and divisions.

PM Modi also spoke about the achievements of Indian doctors and their dedication to providing healthcare services. He acknowledged Doctor's Day, celebrated on July 1, and praised the doctors for their contributions to society.

The broadcast touched upon the significance of Sant Kabir Das and Guru Nanak Dev, who spread messages of unity, compassion, and harmony. PM Modi highlighted the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, which would be celebrated in 2019, and urged people to actively participate in the festivities.

The episode also paid tribute to the victims of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which was to complete 100 years in 2019. PM Modi emphasized that violence and cruelty could never be the solution to problems, and that peace, non-violence, and unity always triumph.

along the people of afghanistan are extremely proud of our hero rashid khan i m also thankful to our indian friends who created a platform for our players to showcase their skills rashid represents what constitutes the best of afghanistan he is an asset to the world of cricket then he quipped no we are not giving him to anyone this match will remain etched in our memories for a long time anyway being the first match it is naturally memorable but i will cherish it for a special reason the indian team did something that is exemplary to the whole world what does a winning team do while receiving the trophy the indian team while receiving the trophy warmly invited the afghanistan team which had played its first international match to pose together for photographs this incident

our armed forces perform yoga on land sea sky a section of our brave soldiers did yoga in submarines some of them chose the snow clad mountainous terrain of siachen for the same our air warriors astounded everyone by performing yogasans in mid sky some 15 thousand feet above the earth spectacular was the fact that they achieved this feat not inside an airplane but while floating mid air schools colleges offices parks skyscrapers playgrounds came alive as yoga venues heartwarming was an instance in ahmedabad around 750 divyang brothers and sisters assembled at one place to do yoga and thus created a world record yogahas broken barriers of caste creed and geography to unite the people of the entire world which is the very essence of the real sentiment innate to vasudhaiva kutumbakam

blessed with a saint a luminary or a great famous personality who has contributed through his sagacity thank you very much for your phone call it is correct that i am reaching maghar on the 28th i am sure you know about kabirwad in gujarat when i used to work there i had organized a national session of people belonging to the tradition of saint kabir once again i have been blessed with the opportunity to visit this samadhi sthal this shrine you must be aware that in eastern uttar pradesh there is a place called maghar it is here that sant kabir das ji attained samadhi do you know why kabir das ji chose to go to maghar in those days it was believed that death in maghar was a roadblock in one s pathway to heaven on the contrary breathing one s last in kaashi was a guarantee for entry into heaven maghar was considered unholy but sant kabirdas never subscribed to that view he toiled relentlessly to quell many such superstitions and evil social customs of his times that is why he went to maghar and chose to attain samadhi there sant kabir das ji through his verses saakhis and dohas stressed upon the virtues of social equality peace and brotherhood these were his ideals we can feel the essence of these ideals in his compositions they are relevant inspiring even in modern times i quote a doha the true saint is the one who recognizes understands the sufferings of others those who do not feel the pain of others are insensitive uncompassionate kabir das ji laid great emphasis on social cohesion he was a thinker way ahead of his times in those days when the whole world was undergoing strife and degradation of moral values he spread the message of peace harmony he worked towards uniting the populace bridging their differences there will be no enmity in the world if the inner being is at peace compassion should be the universal way of life in another doha kabir has written compassion leads to righteousness greed leads to sin anger is sure to devour you forgiveness is a great virtue he said never ask a saint his caste or creed ask him about his repository of knowledge he appealed to the people to rise above divisions of religion caste and make knowledge wisdom the sole basis of recognition his principles are relevant even after several centuries have gone by since we are referring to sant kabir das ji i am reminded of a doha couplet in which he says such is the exalted status accorded to the guru the teacher and one such guru is jagatguru guru nanak dev he showed the righteous path of life to millions inspiring them for centuries guru nanak dev s teachings endeavoured to eradicate caste based discrimination prevalent in society he perceived humankind as one urged everyone to embrace humanity guru nanak devji said that the service to the poor and the needy is service to god wherever he went he took many initiatives for the welfare of the society the establishment of a kitchen free of social discrimination where a person of any caste sect religion or community could eat or what we know as the langarsystem was initiated solely by guru nanak dev ji the 550th prakash parv of guru nanak dev ji will be celebrated in 2019 i want all of us to join this great festival with enthusiasm and fervour to celebrate this festival in the entire indian society and around the world i also urge you to suggest new ideas new concepts and innovations on which we can ponder and make preparations and thus we can also celebrate the prakash parv as prerna parv with great pride my dear countrymen the history of india s struggle for independence is very long very vast and is filled with countless sacrifices there is another chapter of history associated with punjab in the year 2019 100 years of the horrific incident of jallianwala bagh will come to a full circle it was an incident that embarrassed the entire humanity who can forget that dark day of april 13 1919 when abusing all limits of power crossing all the boundaries of cruelty theguiltless unarmed and innocent people were fired upon how can we remember the completion of 100 years of this horrific event is something we canall give a thought to but we must also remember the everlasting message that this incident has imparted that is violence and cruelty can never solve any problem it is peace and non violence renunciation and martyrdom that are triumphant in the end my dear countrymen mr raman kumar of rohini delhi has written on narendra modi mobile app that oncoming july 6 happens to be dr shyama prasad mukherjee s birthday and he wants me to talk about dr shyama prasad mukherjee in this episode of mann ki baat thank you very much raman ji it feels great to see your interest in india s history you know yesterdayjune 23 was the death anniversary of dr shyama prasad mukherjee dr shyama prasad mukherjee was associated with many fields but the areas which were closest to his heart were education administration and parliamentary affairs very few people would know that he was the youngest vice chancellor of the university of calcutta at merely 33 years of age very few people would also be knowing that in 1937 on the invitation of dr shyama prasad mukherjee gurudev rabindranath tagore addressed the convocation in kolkata university in bangla this was the first time under british rule that the convocation in kolkata university had been addressed to in bangla from 1947 to 1950 dr shyama prasad mukherjee was the first industries minister of india and in a sense helaid a strong foundation for india s industrial development he had prepared a solid base it was he who had prepared a stout platform the first industrial policy of independent india which came in 1948 was stamped with his ideas and vision dr mukherjee s dream was for india to be industrially self reliant competent and prosperous in every sphere he had wanted india to develop heavy industries and also pay full attention to msme handloom textiles and cottage industry for the proper development of cottage and small industries with finance availability and organizational setup all india handicrafts board all india handloom board and khadi village industries board were established between 1948 and 1950 there was also a special emphasis by dr mukherjee on indigenization of india s defence production in the establishment of four most successful mega projects chittaranjan locomotive works factory hindustan aircraft factory sindri fertilizer factory and damodar valley corporation and other river valley projects dr shyama prasad mukherjee contributed significantly he was very passionate about the development of west bengal it was the result of his understanding prudence and activism that a part of bengal could be saved and it is still a part of india for dr shyama prasad mukherjee the most important thing was the integrity and unity of india and for this at the young age of 52 he also sacrificed his life come let us forever remember dr shyama prasad mukherjee s message of unity imbued with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and remain proactive with all our might for the progress of india my dear countrymen during the past few weeks i had the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of different schemes of government through video call i got an opportunity to know beyond the confines of the files the changes which are being ushered in the lives of people directly from them people spoke about their determination their happiness and their achievements i believe that this was not a mere governmental programme for me but it was a unique learning experience and during this time the joy of seeing people s faces lit with happiness can be the moment of greatest satisfaction in anyone s life when i would listen to the stories of a common man his guileless words narrating his experience would touch my heart in far distant villages daughters are providing services ranging from pension to issuance of passport to senior citizens through the aegis of common service centers asister from chhattisgarh collects custard apple and does business by making its ice cream like anjan prakash in jharkhand many lakhs of young besides running the yuva jan aushidhi kendras in the country are providing affordable medicines in the nearby villages at the same time a young man from west bengal desperately seeking a job two to three years ago is now a successful entrepreneur and not only this he is providing employment to ten to fifteen people whereas young school students from tamil nadu punjab goa are working on an important topic like waste management in their school s tinkering lab i just do not know how many such stories were shared with me there wasn t a single corner of the country where people did not have a success story of theirs to share with me i am glad that in this entire programme i witnessed the accomplishments of the common man more than the achievements of the government of the country s power the power of new india s dreams the power of the resolve of the new india this is what i experienced there are certain people in society who find no solace till they do not express their frustrated views their depressed views and seek ways to divide rather than unite in such an environment when the common man comes to you talking about emerging hope new zeal and events that have taken place in his life it is not to the government s credit an incident regarding a small girl from a remote village too can inspire the hundred and twenty five crore people with the help of technology through the video bridge even a single moment spentwith the beneficiaries was very enjoyable very motivational and provided satisfaction to work more there is a renewed joy in dedicating your life for the upliftment and you re left with renewed fervour and inspiration i am very grateful to the countrymen 40 50 lakh people participated in this video bridge program and imparted me with a new strength i again want to express my gratitude to you all my dear countrymen i always feel that if we look around us somewhere or something good always happens many good people out there are involved in beneficial work we can also smell the fragrance of righteousness in the past one thing came to my attention and it happens to be a very unique combination on one hand where we have professionals and engineers on the other hand there exist farmers tilling the fields our brethren sisters associated with agriculture now you must be wondering that these are two completely different occupations what is the relation between these professions but there exists a link in bangalore corporate professionals and it engineers came along and created an effortless samridhi trust with which they have doubled the income of the farmers by successful activation of this trust this trust remained associated with farmers drew plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers the training to inculcate organic farming while teaching latest agricultural techniques and how to grow more crops along with a single cash crop in the fields was imparted through the professional engineers and technocrats associated with this trust started giving training to the farmers the farmers who initially used to depend on the same single cash crop in their fields and that too the yield was also not good begetting lesser profits today are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their own vegetables and getting good prices through the trust farmers producing grains have also become associated with this trust on one hand farmers have a major role in the entire chain from cultivation till the marketing of crops whereas on the other hand to make certain the farmers participation in reaping profits is an attempt to guarantee their right a separate seed bank has been created to make good agricultural strains available for reaping a bumper harvest women have also been added in this activity and they supervise the work of this seed bank i congratulate these young people for this innovative experiment and i am happy that these young professionals technocrats and others associated with the world of engineering got out of their comfort zone to make a connect with the farmer the village fields and barns friends your youth power is really inspiring for any young person many other young people of our country will definitely visit your website and look closely at your work and will also be inspired by how they can be of use in different areas of the social milieu in their area i once again felicitate the youth of my country for their innovative experiments some of which i might have got to know some might have escaped me some people might or may not be aware of but nonetheless i wish countless people involved in doing beneficial work very good luck from my side my dear countrymen it s been an year when gst was implemented one nation one tax was the dream of the people of this country that has become a reality today if i ve to give credit to anyone for successful implementation of one nation one tax reform then i credit the states of our nation gst is a great example of cooperative federalism where all the states decided to take a unanimous decision in the interest of the nation and then such a huge tax reform could be implemented in the country so far there have been 27 meetings of the gst council and we can all feel proud that people from different political ideologies have been involved in these meetings these meetings involve representatives of different states states which have different priorities but in spite of all this all the decisions that have been taken in the gst council so far have been taken with absolute consensus before the onset of gst scheme there were 17 different types of taxes prevailing in the country but now only one tax is applicable in the entire country gst is not only the victory of integrity but it is also a celebration of honesty earlier in the case of taxation and allied affairs in the country there were rampant complaints of inspector raj in the gst scheme information technology has replaced the inspector everything from return to refund is done through online information technology the check post has become extinct after the arrival of the gst scheme and the movement of goods has become faster which not only saves time but is also accruing benefits in the areaof logistics gst is probably be the biggest tax reform in the world the successful implementation of such a huge tax reform in india was successful only because the people of the country adopted it and through the power of the masses fuelled the success of the gst scheme it is generally believed that such a big tax reform in a huge country like ours with such a large population takes 5 to 7 years for effective adoption however within a year the enthusiasm of the honest people of this nation the celebration of integrity in the country and the participation of people resulted in this new tax system managing to create a space for itself has achieved stability and according to the need it will bring reform through its inbuilt arrangement this is a huge success in itself which 125 crore indians have earned for themselves my dear countrymen once again while concluding this episode i wait most eagerly for the next chapter of mann ki baat of meeting you and talking to you i wish you many felicitations thank you very much a historic test match in bengaluru

not worrying whether it is day or night i have now dedicated myself for this purpose only akhil prime minister prime minister yes akhil if you are so busy during the day then i m curious to know

nor do i watch tv with the same intent i watch very little earlier i used to watch discovery channel for the sake of curiosity and i used to read books but these days i am unable to read and due to

celebrated on the 7thof december this is the day when we pay homage to our brave soldiers for their valour their sacrifices we also contribute only a sense of respect does not suffice participation is also necessary and every citizen should come forward on the 7thof december and everyone should possess the flag of the armed forces on that day everyone should also contribute come on this occasion let us express our gratitude for the indomitable courage valour and spirit of dedication of our armed forces and remember the brave soldiers my dear countrymen by now you must be familiar with the fit india movement cbse has taken a commendable initiative of introducing the concept of fit india week schools can celebrate fit india week anytime during the month of december there are many types of events to be organized with regards to the aspect of fitness this includes quiz essays articles paintings traditional and local sports yogasana dance sports and games competitions students as well as their teachers and parents can also participate in the fit india week but don t forget that fit india doesn t mean just exercising the mind or making fitness plans on paper or merely looking at fitness apps on the laptop or computer or on a mobile phone not at allyou ve to sweat it out the food habits have to change the habit of maximising focus activity should be inculcated i appeal to the school boards and management of all the states of the country that fit india week should be celebrated in every school in the month of december this will inculcate the habit of fitness in our daily routine in the fit india movement schedules have been drawn for ranking schools in accordance with fitness the schools that achieve this ranking will also be able to use the fit india logo and flag the schools can declare themselves as fit by visiting the fit india portal fit india three star and fit india five star ratings will also be given i appeal that all schools should enroll in the fit india ranking system and fit india should become innate to our temperament that it become a mass movement and bring awareness is what we must strive for my dear countrymen our country is so large so full of diversity it is so ancient that so many things just slip our mind and that s quite natural but i do wish to share something with you i happened to glance at a comment on the mygov portal a few days ago mr ramesh sharma from nagaon in assam has written this comment he writes that a festival is being celebrated on brahmaputra river it s called brahmaputra pushkar this festival was held between 4th and 16th november and people had come from all corners of the country to take part in this brahmaputra pushkar weren t you also surprised to hear this see that s the thing this is such an important festival and our forefathers have fashioned it in a way that once you hear the full details you will be even more surprised but unfortunately the extent to which this should have been publicized the extent to which this information should have been disseminated to every corner of the country it isn t done and it is also true that this event in a way signifies the concept of one country one message and that we are all one it fills us with that feeling it energises us first of all let me thank shri ramesh for having shared his thoughts with the entire country through the man ki baat forum you have also agonized about the fact that such an important event is not adequately publicized not discussed as much as it should be i can empathise with you not many people in the country know about this well if someone would have given it the moniker international river festival or used some other highfalutin lingo to reference it well then it might have resulted in some sort of discussion around this topic in the country my dear countrymen pushkaram pushkaraalu pushkaraha have you ever heard these terms do you know what these are let me tell you these are the different names by which festivals organized on 12 different rivers across the country are called one river every year that means it would recur on that particular river after 12 years and this festival is held sequentially every year in 12 different rivers spread across the country and it lasts for 12 long days just like the kumbh festival this too encourages the concept of national unity and echoes the philosophy of ek bharat shreshth bharat one india best india pushkaram is a festival in which the greatness of the river the glory of the river the importance of the river in our lives all these are brought forth naturally our forefathers put a lot of emphasis on nature on environment on water on land on forests they understood the importance of rivers and tried to inculcate a positive mindset towards rivers in the society they constantly strove to conflate the river with the cultural stream the stream of tradition and with the society and the interesting thing is that not only did it bring the society closer to the rivers it also brought people closer to each other last year the pushkaram was held on the taamirabarani river in tamil nadu this year it was held on the brahmaputra river next year it will be held in telangana andhra pradesh and karnataka on the tungabhadra river in a way you can travel to all these 12 places as part of a tourist circuit as well here i would like to appreciate the warmth and hospitality of the people of assam who acted as wonderful hosts for pilgrims from all over the country the organizers also paid great attention to cleanliness they ensured plastic free zones bio toilets were also provided at many places i hope that this ancient festival that has helped create a positive mindset towards rivers among us will continue to bring our future generations also closer to the rivers nature environment water all these things should not only be part of our tourism they should also be a part of our lives my dear countrymen young shweta writes in from madhya pradesh on the namo app and she says sir i am studying in class 9 and there is still a year to go before i sit for my board examinations but i regularly listen to your conversations with students and exam warriors the reason i am writing to you is that you have not yet shared with us the scheduled date for your next interaction on examinations please schedule it at the earliest if possible please schedule it in january friends this is something i really like about the man ki baat programme the love and sense of entitlement with which my young friends complain to me instruct me or give suggestions to me i really am gladdened by them shveta ji you have raised this issue at an opportune time exams are round the corner so like every other year we need to discuss examinations and you are right that this program needs to be scheduled a bit earlier after the last exam interaction many people have written in with suggestions to make it more effective some have even complained that it was held too close to the date of the exam and shweta is right that i should conduct it in the month of january the hrd ministry and the mygov team are jointly working on it it will be my endeavour to hold this discussion on exams in the beginning or middle of january student friends across the country have two opportunities one they can become part of this through their respective schools alternatively they can be part of the program being conducted here in delhi students participating in the delhi event will be selected through the mygov portal friends we have to banish the fear of examinations collectively i want to see my young friends smiling during examinations their parents should be stress free teachers should be assured we have been constantly striving to achieve this objective through the man ki baat program through the discussions on examinations townhall or through the exam warriors book students parents and teachers from across the country have taken this mission forward and i am grateful to all of them we will all celebrate the upcoming program on examination discussion together i cordially invite you all friends in the last edition of man ki baat we had discussed the 2010 allahabad high court judgment on the ayodhya issue and i have referred to how we had maintained peace and harmony back then whether it was before the verdict or after the verdict this time too when the supreme court pronounced its judgment on 9th november 130 crore indians once again proved that for them national interest is supreme the values of peace unity and goodwill are paramount in our country when the verdict on ram mandir was pronounced the entire country embraced it with open arms they accepted the verdict with ease and with peace today through the man ki baat program i would like to appreciate and thank my countrymen i am particularly grateful to them for the patience restraint and maturity shown by them on the one hand a protracted legal battle has finally come to an end on the other hand the respect for the judiciary has grown in the country in the truest sense this verdict has also proved to be a milestone for the judiciary in our country after this historic verdict of the supreme court the country has moved ahead on a new path with a new resolve full of new hopes and aspirations it is my hope and wish that new india imbibes this feeling and forges ahead in a spirit of peace unity and goodwill it is the wish of each one of us my dear countrymen our civilization culture and languages preach the message of unity in diversity to the entire world 130 crore indians belong to a country about which it is said the taste of the water changes after every couple of kilometers the lingo changes every few miles hundreds of languages have blossomed and flourished in our country for centuries at the same time we are also concerned about the possible extinction of these languages and dialects recently i read a story from dhaarchulaa in uttaraakhand that gave me a lot of satisfaction after reading that story i got to know how people are coming forward to promote their languages in innovative ways i was attracted to this story from dhaarchulaa since i too have stayed there while travelling it has nepal on one side kali ganga on the other side so it s natural that my attention was drawn to this story from dhaarchulaa there are many people of the rang community who inhabit dhaarchulaa in pithauraagarh they converse among one another in the ranglo language they are quite saddened by the fact that the number of people who speak this language is rapidly dwindling and then one fine day they got together and resolved to save their language and in no time people from the rang community joined in you will be amazed to hear that there are only a handful of people in this community roughly their number is estimated to be around ten thousand but in order to save the ranglo language everyone contributed their mite be it an 84 year old elderly man diwan singh or a 22 year old youth vaishali garbyaal be it a professor or a trader everyone contributed in whatever way they could in this mission ample use was also made of the social media many whatsapp groups were formed hundreds of people were connected to this mission through these groups this language does not have a script it finds usage only in the spoken form so people started posting stories poems and songs they started correcting each other s language errors so in a way whatsapp became a kind of classroom where everyone was a student and a teacher at the same time there is an effort to conserve the ranglo language in all this different kinds of programs are being held magazines are being published and social institutions are also assisting in this effort friends another important thing to note is that the united nations has declared 2019 as the international year of indigenous languages that means efforts are being made to conserve those languages which are on the verge of extinction hundred and fifty years ago the father of modern hindi bharatendu harishchandra had also said the progress of one s language is the source of one s overall progress all progress is meaningless if one s mother tongue is neglected that means no progress is possible without the knowledge of one s mother tongue this initiative of the rang community thus is sure to be showing the path to the rest of the world if you too have been inspired by this story then start using your language or dialect from today inspire the society and your family to do so towards the end of the 19th century mahakavi great poet subramanya bharati had said and he had said in tamil mupppadu kodi mugam udai yaal uyir moim bura ondrudaiyaal ival seppu mozhi padinettudaiyaal enil sindanai ondrudaiyaal and he said it back then i am referring to the second half of the 19th century and he said that mother india has 30 crore faces but one body she speaks 18 languages but thinks as one my dear countrymen there are times when mundane things in life enrich us with a great message just the other day i was reading a story in the media on scuba divers this is a story that can be inspiring for all indians one day these scuba divers who impart training in vishakhapattanam were obstructed by plastic bottles and pouches on their way back from sea on mangamaripetta beach while cleaning the litter they found the matter grave they were appalled at the way our sea is being littered with garbage for the last many days these divers go up to 100 mts away from the coast dive deep and take out the garbage lying around and i am told that just within 13 days ie 2 weeks they have removed more than 4000kg of plastic waste from the sea this small beginning by the divers is being transformed into a big mission they are being helped by local people now local fishermen have also started to help them by all means pondering over taking inspiration from these scuba divers if we too take a pledge to rid our surroundings of plastic waste plastic free india can become a new example for the whole world my dear countrymen the 26th

unturned in the vaccination of our countrymen our health workers through their tireless efforts and resolve set a new example they established a new benchmark in service to humanity through innovation

wishes to you and family from my side my dear countrymen you are aware that next sunday the 31st of october is the birth anniversary of sardar patel ji on behalf of every listener of mann ki baat and from myself i bow to the lauh purush the iron man friends we celebrate the 31st of october as national unity day it is our duty that we must associate ourselves with some activity that conveys the message of national unity you must have noticed that recently gujarat police took out a bike rally from the lakhpat fort in kutch to the statue of unity to celebrate unity day the personnel of tripura police are organising a bike rally from tripura to the statue of unity that is connecting the country from east to west personnel of jammu kashmir police too are giving this message of unity of the country by taking out a similar bike rally from uri to pathankot i salute all these jawans i have also come to know of many sisters from kupawara district of jammu kashmir itself in kashmir these sisters are working to make the tricolour for the army and government offices this work is brimming with the sentiment of patriotism i appreciate the spirit of these sisters you too must do something for the unity of india for the greatness of india you will see how satisfying this is friends sardar sahab used to say we can take our country to loftier heights only through our united efforts if we don t have unity amongst ourselves we will get entangled in ever new calamities that is with national unity the nation has stature and has development we can learn a lot from the life and thoughts of sardar patel the information and broadcasting ministry of the country has recently published a pictorial biography of sardar saheb too i would want that all our young friends must read this by this you will get a chance to know of sardar saheb in an interesting way dear countrymen life desires continuous progress desires development desires to surpass heights however much science may advance however much the pace of progress may be however grand the buildings may be life feels incomplete but when song music art drama dance literature is added to these their aura their liveliness increases many times in a way if life has to be meaningful all these too are as necessary that is why it is said that all these forms act as a catalyst in our lives act to enhance our energy the role of songs music and other art forms is major in developing the inner self of humans in creating the path of journey of our inner self and another strength of these is that neither time nor boundaries can limit them not even beliefs or discordance can limit these the colours of one s art culture song music must certainly be filled in amrit mahotsav too i too am getting several suggestions from you regarding amrit mahotsav and this strength of songs music arts these suggestions are very valuable for me i had sent them to the culture ministry for analysis i am happy that in such a short time span the ministry took up the suggestions very seriously and has also worked on it one of these suggestions is of a competition on patriotic songs during the freedom struggle patriotic songs and devotional songs in different languages dialects had united the entire country now in this amrit kaal our young people can instill this event with energy by writing such patriotic songs these patriotic songs can be in the mother tongue can be in national language and can be written in english too but it is essential that these creations reflect the thought of new india inspired by the current success of the country it should be such that fuels the country s resolve for the future the culture ministry is geared to conduct a competition related to this from tehsil to the national level friends similarly a listener of mann ki baat has suggested that amrit mahotsav should be connected to the art of rangoli too for centuries we have had a tradition of lending colours to festivals through rangoli the diversity of our country is visible in rangoli rangoli is drawn in different states with different names and on different themes therefore the ministry of culture is also going to conduct a national competition associated with this just imagine when a rangoli related to the freedom movement will be created people will draw a picture of a hero of the freedom struggle at their door on their wall and depict an event of our independence movement with colours hues of the amrit festival will also increase manifold friends we also have another art form known as lori here samskars are inculcated in young children through lullabies and they are introduced to the culture lullabies also have their own diversity so why don t we in the amritkaal period revive this art also and write lullabies pertaining to patriotism write poems songs something or the other which can be easily recited by mothers in every home to their little children in these lullabies there should be reference to modern india the vision of 21st century india and its dreams the ministry has decided to organize a competition related to it after receiving suggestions from the listeners friends these three competitions are going to commence on the birth anniversary of sardar sahib from 31st october in the coming days the ministry of culture will provide all the information related to these events this information will also be available on the website of the ministry and will be circulated through social media i want you all to be associated with this our young friends must showcase their art their talent in this through this the art and culture of your area will also reach every nook and corner of the country your stories will be heard by the whole country dear countrymen during this period of amrit mahotsav we are remembering the brave sons and daughters of the country those great and virtuous souls next month the birth anniversary of one such icon and a brave warrior bhagwan birsa munda ji is falling on the 15th of november bhagwan birsa munda is also known as dharti aaba do you know what this epithet means it means the father of earth the way bhagwan birsa munda fought to protect his culture his forest his land it could have only been done by dharti aaba he taught us to be proud of our culture and roots the foreign rule subjected him to countless threats and applied immense pressure but he did not relinquish the tribal culture if we have to learn to love nature and the environment then for that too dharati aaba bhagwan birsa munda is one of our greatest inspirations he strongly opposed every such policy of foreign rule which was detrimental for the environment bhagwan birsa munda was always at the forefront while helping the poor and the distressed he also made the society aware towards eliminating social evils who can forget his leadership during the ulgulan movement this movement shook the british and as an aftermath the british had placed a huge reward on bhagwan birsa munda the british government put him in jail he was tortured to such an extent that he left us at the age of less than 25years he left us but only in the body in the public psyche lord birsa munda resides forever his life remains an inspirational force for the people even today folk songs and stories full of his courage and valour are very popular in the central region of india i bow to dharti aaba birsa munda and urge the youth to read more about him the more you know about the unique contribution of our tribal populace in the freedom struggle of india the more you will feel proud my dear countrymen today on 24th october un day i e united nations day is celebrated this is the day when the united nations was established india has been a member since the formation of the united nations do you know that india had signed the charter of the united nations in 1945 prior to independence a unique feature related to the united nations is that the woman power of india has played a large role in increasing the influence and strength of the united nations in 1947 48 when the universal declaration of un human rights was being drafted it was being inscribed in that declaration all men are created equal but a delegate from india objected to this and then it was written in the universal declaration all human beings are created equal this was in consonance with india s age old tradition of gender equality did you know that smt hansa mehta was the delegate because of whom this became possible at the same time another delegate smt lakshmi menon had strongly put forth her views on the issue of gender equality and not only this in 1953 smt vijaya lakshmi pandit became the first woman president of the un general assembly friends we are the people of a land who believe and pray om dyau shanti rantariksha gwamshantih prithvi shanti rapah shanti roshadhayahshantih vanas patayah shanti vishweddevah shanti brahma shantih sarvag wamshantih shanti reva shantih sa ma shanti redhi om shantihshantihshantih india has always strove for world peace we are proud of the fact that india has been a part of un peacekeeping missions continuously since the 1950s india is also playing a leading role in addressing issues related to poverty alleviation climate change and workers apart from this india is working closely with who or world health organization to popularize yoga and ayush in march 2021 who announced that a global centre for traditional medicine would be set up in india friends today while talking about the united nations i m also remembering the words of atal ji in 1977 he made history by addressing the united nations in hindi today i want to play an excerpt of atal ji s address for the listeners of mann ki baat listen to atal ji s resounding voice here i am not thinking about the supremacy and prominence of nations the esteem and advancement of the common man are of more importance to me ultimately the only criterion to measure our successes and failures is whether we strive to assure justice and dignity to the entire humanity virtually every man woman and child friends these words of atal ji show us the way even today india s contribution in making this earth a better and safer planet is a big inspiration for the entire world my dear countrymen just a few days ago on the 21st of october we celebrated police commemoration day on this day we especially remember our brave hearts of the police who have laid down their lives in the service of the country today i would like to remember these policemen along with their families a tough service like the police is very difficult without the support and sacrifice of the family there is one more thing related to police service that i want to convey to the listeners of mann ki baat earlier it was believed that services like army and police are meant only for men but today it is not so the statistics from the bureau of police research and development show that in the last few years the number of women police personnel has doubled in 2014 while their number was close to 1 lakh 5 thousand by 2020 it has increased by more than double and this number has now reached up to 2 lakh 15 thousand even in the central armed police forces the number of women has almost doubled in the last seven years and i m not talking just about numbers today the daughters of the country are performing even the toughest duties with full force and zeal for example many daughters are currently undergoing one of the most difficult trainings that of specialized jungle warfare commandos they will be a part of our cobra battalion friends today when we go to airports metro stations or see government offices brave women of cisf are seen guarding every sensitive place the most positive effect of this is on the morale of our police force as well as society the presence of women security personnel naturally instills a sense of confidence among the people especially women they naturally feel connected to women security personnel because of the sensitivity in women people tend to trust them more these policewomen of ours are also becoming role models for lakhs of other daughters of the country i would like to request the women police personnel to visit the schools in their areas once the schools open and talk to the girls there i am sure that this conversation will give a new direction to our new generation not just that it will also increase public confidence in the police i hope that more women will join the police service in future lead the new age policing of our country my dear countrymen in the last few years the pace at which the use of modern technology has increased in our country the listeners of mann ki baat often keep writing to me about it today i want to discuss with you one such topic which has caught the imagination of our country especially our youth and even little children this topic is of drones of the drone technology up until a few years ago when the name of drone used to come up what used to be the first feeling in the minds of the people of the army of weapons of war but today if we have any wedding procession or function we see a drone shooting photos and videos the spectrum of a drone s usage and its capabilities is not just limited to that india is one of the first countries in the world which is preparing digital records of land in its villages with the help of drones india is working extensively on using drones for transportation whether it is farming in the village or delivery of goods at home providing help in emergency or monitoring law and order it is not long before we will see drones being deployed for all these needs of ours most of these have already started like a few days ago nano urea was sprayed in the fields through drones in bhavnagar gujarat drones are also playing their role in the covid vaccine campaign we got to see a picture of this in manipur where vaccines were delivered via a drone to an island telangana has also done trials for vaccine delivery by drone not just that drones are also being used to monitor many big infrastructure projects i have also read about a young student who with the help of his drone worked to save the lives of fishermen friends earlier there were so many rules laws and restrictions in this sector that it was not possible to unlock the real capabilities of a drone the technology that should have been seen as an opportunity was seen as a crisis if you have to fly a drone for any work then there was such a hassle of license and permission that people would give up on the mere mention of the name of drone we decided that this mindset has to be changed and new trends have to be adopted which is why on the 25th of august this year the country brought forward a new drone policy this policy has been formulated according to the present and future prospects related to drones with this you will neither have to be entangled in the web of multiple forms anymore nor will you have to pay as much fees as before i am happy to inform you that after the introduction of the new drone policy foreign and domestic investors have invested in many drone start ups many companies are also setting up manufacturing units the army navy and air force have also placed orders worth more than rs 500 crores with the indian drone companies and this is just the beginning we must not stop here we have to become a leading country in drone technology for this the government is taking all possible steps i will also urge the youth of the country to certainly think about taking advantage of the opportunities created after the drone policy and come forward my dear countrymen a listener of mann ki baat shrimati prabha shukla from meerut in up has sent me a letter related to cleanliness she has written we all celebrate cleanliness during festivals in india similarly if we make cleanliness a daily habit then the whole country will become clean i appreciate prabha ji s message indeed where there is cleanliness there is health where there is health there is capability and where there is capability there is prosperity that is why the country is giving so much emphasis on swachh bharatabhiyan friends i was happy to know about saparom naya sarai a village near ranchi there used to be a pond in this village but people had started using this pond area for defecating in the open under the swachh bharat abhiyan after toilets were built in everyone s homes the villagers thought why not make the village clean as well as beautiful lo and behold everyone got together and made a park at the place of the pond today that place has become a community spot for people for children this has brought a big change in the life of the whole village i also want to tell you about the women of deur village of chhattisgarh the women here run a self help group and work together to clean the village squares roads and temples friends the people of ghaziabad in up know ramveer tanwar as the pond man ramveer ji was doing a job after completing his mechanical engineering however such a sense of devotion for cleanliness ignited in his mind that he left his job and started cleaning ponds so far ramveer ji has revived many ponds by cleaning them friends the efforts of cleanliness can be fully successful only when every citizen understands cleanliness as his or her responsibility now during diwali we are all about to get involved in cleaning our houses but during this time we have to take care that our neighbourhood along with our house should also be clean it should not be that we clean our house but the dirt of our house reaches outside on our roads and yes when i talk about cleanliness then please do not forget the mantra of getting rid of single use plastic come let us take a pledge that we will not let the enthusiasm of swachh bharat abhiyan diminish together we will make our country completely clean and keep it clean my dear countrymen the whole month of october is painted in the hues of festivals and after a few days from now diwali will be around the corner diwali then govardhan puja then bhai dooj these three festivals shall of course be there and there will also be chhath puja during this interregnum it is also the birth anniversary of guru nanak dev ji in november when so many festivals happen together then their preparations also start long before all of you must have started planning for shopping from now on but do you remember shopping means vocal for local if you buy local then your festival will also be illuminated and the house of a poor brother or sister an artisan or a weaver will also be lit up i am sure that the campaign which we all have started together will be stronger this time during the festivals do share on social media about the local products you buy from there too inform those around you too we ll meet again next month and we ll once again discuss many such topics many

the country emotions of our people which include their desires expectations and at times even grievances which come to their minds and i have never said that these are the expressions of my mind mann ki baat reflects our countrymen s minds their expressions their expectations and when i say things in mann ki baat people from across the country send their ideas experiences and feelings to me i am probably not able to convey all these to you but still i get a treasure full of ideas over e mail over telephone over mygov or over narendramodiapp i receive a multitude of such ideas and suggestions most of these are inspiring to me a large number of these ideas are regarding improvements in the functioning of our government there are personal grievances and complaints and sometimes attention is drawn to community problems i just take half an hour of your time in a month but people keep sending suggestions ideas and other material over mann ki baat during all 30 days of the month and the result of this whole exercise is that the government has started realizing the sensitivities and powerful ideas of the people of far off places and this is why the three year journey of mann ki baat is in fact a journey of our countrymen their emotions and their feelings i am thankful to our countrymen for having provided me an opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man in mann ki baat i have always remembered one sentence of acharya vinoba bhave he always used to say a sarkari asarkari meaning non government is effective i have also tried to focus on the people of the country in mann ki baat have kept it away from political hues tried to remain connected with you with a stable mind rather than being diverted by the heat of the moment or anguish i surely believe and feel that now after three years social scientists universities research scholars media experts would undertake its analysis and highlight its every aspect positive as well as negative and i am sure that this brainstorming could be useful for mann ki baat in future and will infuse a new energy into it and in one episode of mann ki baat i had said that while having our food we must also be conscious of consuming only as much as we need and see to it that there is no wastage but later i received letters from all corners of the country many social organizations and many youth are already observing this in practice i come to know about a lot many people who were involved in ensuring that leftover food was best utilized i derived much satisfaction and joy to learn this once in mann ki baat i had mentioned about a retired teacher from maharashtra shriman chandrakant kulkarni who donated 51 post dated cheques of rs 5 000 each for the cleanliness drive out of his total monthly pension of rs 16 000 and then i saw that a lot many people came forward to donate for this cause once i saw a selfie of a sarpanch with a daughter and referred to the same in mann ki baat in no time selfie with daughter became a big campaign not only in india but across the whole world this is not only an issue of social media it became an incident to create a new self confidence and a feeling of self pride in every daughter every parent started feeling that they should take a selfie with their daughter every daughter started regaining her own self confidence self esteem i was in a meeting with the tourism department recently i asked people who were planning to go travelling that where ever they visit incredible india they must send photographs of those places lakhs of photographs from every corner of india were received which actually became a treasure for those working in the tourism sector i ve experienced through mann ki baat that even a tiny incident can launch a massive campaign today i felt like sharing it since i thought that it has been three years and events incidents over those three years ran across my mind the nation is always ready to move in the right direction every citizen of the country wants to do something for the benefit of others for social good for the country s progress this is what i gathered learnt and understood from our countrymen during three years of the mann ki baat campaign this is the most valuable capital and enormous strength for any country i heartily bow to my countrymen in one episode of mann ki baat i had discussed about khadi and khadi is not a fabric but an idea a principle i have noticed that these days interest in khadi has increased very much and i had just said that i was not asking people to makeover into wearing khadi permanently rather since there are a number of fabrics then why not khadi also be one of the fabrics of your choice may be a bed sheet in the house a handkerchief or a curtain it has been felt that the younger generation has got interested in khadi sale of khadi has increased and as a result of this the poor man s household has directly got connected to employment discount is offered on khadi from 2nd october and people get quite a good rebate i once again urge that we should try and take forward the khadi movement we should follow the spirit of helping the poor to be able to light a diwali lamp the poor of our country will derive strength from this and we must do it the increasing interest in khadi has infused a new thinking in those working in the khadi sector as well as those connected in any way with khadi how do we bring in new technology how do we increase productivity how do we introduce looms driven by solar power how do we rejuvenate our traditional heritage which was lying inactive for 20 25 or 30 years sewapuri khadi ashram at varanasi in uttar pradesh was lying closed for 26 years but has got a fresh lease of life now a number of thoughts were implemented new employment opportunities were created for a number of people khadi gramodyog revived its training centre at pampore in kashmir and in this sector kashmir has so much to offer with the reopening of this training centre the new generation will get a boost in jobs in manufacturing in weaving in creating new things and it feels so good to see that even big corporate houses have started including khadi items as diwali gifts even people have started exchanging khadi items as gifts we now experience how something grows naturally my dear countrymen we had taken a resolve in last month s mann ki baat and had decided to observe a 15 day cleanliness festival before gandhi jayanti we shall connect people through cleanliness our honourable president inaugurated this programme and the country got connected the old or the young men or women city or village everyone has become a part of this cleanliness campaign now and when i say sankalp se siddhi we can see for ourselves as to how a cleanliness campagin is advancing towards sankalp siddhi that is attainment through reslove everyone accepts this co operates in this and makes a contribution in realizing this i am grateful to our honourable president but every section of society has taken this as its own campaign everyone has got connected to this whether it be people from the sports world academicians schools colleges universities farmers workers officers government employees police or army jawans every one has got connected with this a kind of a pressure has been created in public places and now people resist if someone tries to spoil or to make a public place dirty in any way and even those spoiling public places are also feeling this pressure it is a good thing and i am pleased to know that just in the first four days of swachhata hi sewa abhiyan more than 75 lakh people joined these activities with more than 40 thousand initiatives i have seen that some people are continuously working and are determined to bring out results i noticed something else this time one is that we clean up a place and the second is that we become aware and do not spread filth but if we have to inculcate cleanliness as a habit we must start an idea based movement also this time a number of competitions were organized on the theme cleanliness is service more than two and a half crore children took part in an essay competition on cleanliness thousands of children made paintings they drew pictures based on their own imaginations many people wrote poems and these days i post drawings made by our young children on social media and praise their efforts whenever there is a reference to cleanliness i do not forget to express my gratitude to media persons they have taken this campaign in a religious manner they have made a big contribution in creating a positive environment and are leading the cleanliness campaign in their own ways we can see in swachhata hi sewa movement as to how the electronic media and the print media in our country can render a big service to the country just a few days ago some one drew my attention towards bilal dar a young man of 18 years from srinagar and you will be glad to know that srinagar municipal corporation has made him their brand ambassador and when there is a talk of brand ambassador there is a general feeling that he she must be a cine artist or a sports personality but not in this case bilal dar got connected to the swachhata abhiyan or cleanliness campaign since the age of 12 13 years and has been working for the last 5 to 6 years he clears plastic polythene used bottles dry or wet waste every piece of dirt from aisa s biggest lake near srinagar he also earns from this activity his father had died of cancer at a very young age but he connected his livelihood with cleanliness i congratulate srinagar municipal corporation for taking this initiative towards sanitation and for their imagination to appoint an ambassador for this cause of cleanliness because srinagar is a tourist destination and every indian wants to go there and if such attention is given to cleanliness it is a very big achievement in itself and i am glad that they have not only appointed bilal as their ambassador but also given him a vehicle and also a uniform and he goes to other areas and educates people about cleanliness and inspires them and keeps tracking them till results are achieved bilal is very young age wise but is a source of inspiration for all of us who are interested in cleanliness i congratulate bilal dar my dear countrymen we will have to accept the fact that history begets history and when there is a reference to history it is but natural to recall our great men the month of october is a month to remember so many of our titans from mahatma gandhi to sardar patel there are many great leaders who gave us the direction towards the 20th and 21st century led us guided us and faced so many hardships for the country 2nd october is the birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi and lal bahadur shastri 11th october is the birth anniversary of jai prakash narain and nanaji deshmukh and pandit deen dayal upadhyay s birth anniversary falls on 25th september this is the centenary year of nanaji and deen dayal ji and what was the main focus of all these great men one thing was common and that was to live for the country do something for the nation they led the people not by mere sermons but by their actions gandhiji jai prakashji deen dayalji were such great personalities who remained far away from the corridors of power but lived every moment for the people kept fighting all odds following the principle sarv jan hitay sarv jan sukhay they kept endeavouring tirelessly nanaji deshmukh left politics and joined the gramodaya movement and while celebrating his centenary year it is but natural to honour his contribution towards gramodaya india s former president shriman abdul kalamji used to speak of nanaji s contribution in rural development while talking to the youth he used to mention nanaji s contribution with great respect and he even went to a village to see nanaji s work there like gandhiji deen dayal upadhyayji also talked about the last person at the farthest fringes deen dayalji talked about the poorest of the poor the deprived distressed ones and spoke of how through education employment or otherwise his life could be transformed we are not obliging these great men by remembering them but we remember them so that we may be able to foresee our forays into the future and the direction we choose in the next mann ki baat i will surely mention sardar vallabh bhai patel but on 31st october run for unity ek bharat shreshth bharat will be organized throughout the country there should be a number of run for unity programmes in every city every town and the weather is also such that one would enjoy running it is essential for developing a will power of steel like that of sardar saheb sardar saheb unified the country we also have to run for unity in order to promote the mantra of unity the element of unity in diversity being india s speciality comes naturally to us we feel proud of diversity but have you ever tried to feel this diversity i would like to re iterate to my countrymen and specially to my young friends that we are alive aware beings we should feel india s diversity touch it feel its fragrance you may see for yourself that for your inner development also these diversities of our country work as a big teaching tool there are vacations diwali is drawing near all around in our country there is an inclination to travel to some place or the other people go as tourists and it is very natural but it is a matter of concern when we do not see our own country we do not know about its diversities nor do we understand them impressed by mere superficial glitter we have started enjoying touring foreign countries only you travel around the world i have no issues but have a look at your own country too people of north india may not be knowing what all is there in the south people of west india may not be knowing what all is there in the east our country is full of such myriad diversities if you refer to mahatma gandhi lokmanya tilak swami vivekanand our former president abdul kalamji then you will notice that when they toured around india they got to see and understand india and they got inspired to do and die for the country all these great men travelled widely in india at the beginning of their endeavour they tried to know and understand india tried to live india within themselves can we make an effort as a student to learn understand and try to live as per the traditions culture attire eating habits and beliefs of different states different societies different groups of our country there will be a value addition in tourism only when we travel not only as a visitor but also like a student and make efforts to assimilate understand adapt this is my personal experience i had a chance of visiting more than five hundred districts of india in more than four hundred fifty districts i had a night stay too and now when i am shouldering this responsibility in india that travel is coming in very handy and proving to be very useful that helps me a lot in understanding things i request you too to feel the unity in diversity which is not a mere slogan but is a storehouse of enormous energy the dream of ek bharat shreshtha bharat is inherent in this how many varieties of cuisines there are if we eat a new dish every day we won t have to repeat any variety throughout our life this is the power of our tourism i would request that during these vacations do not go out just for a change but leave with the intention to know understand gain something internalize india within yourselves internalize the diversities of millions of denizens of india within you these experiences will enrich your lives your vision will expand and who can be a better teacher than experience generally october to march is the suitable time for tourism people travel i am sure that even this time if you go you will lend further fillip to my campaign wherever you go share your experiences share photographs you must send photographs on incredibleindia if you happen to meet people there send their photos too write not only about architecture or natural beauty but write something about their daily life too write good travelogues send on mygov and on narendramodiapp a thought comes to my mind that in order to promote tourism in india what could be the seven best tourist destinations in your state every indian must know about these seven tourist spots of his state if possible one must visit these seven places can you provide some information about that can you post on narendramodiapp can you post on incredibleindia you see if all the people of one state will do this then i will ask the government to do a scrutiny of it and prepare publicity material based on seven common things received from each state in other words how can tourist destination be developed keeping public aspirations in mind similarly whatever you have seen throughout india and whichever seven out of these you liked the best and you wish that someone should see these things or should go there should get information about them then you must send photos and information of seven such tourist spots on mygov or on narendramodiapp the government of india will work on that the government will accept suggestions about making films videos or preparing publicity material and about promoting that destination come get connected with me you can also act as a major catalyst in promoting the tourism of our country by utilizing the time from this october to march i invite you my dear countrymen being a human being there are many things that touch me too they agitate my heart they leave a deep impression on my heart after all i am also a human being just like you

the way little akarshna is doing a great job in shaping the future of children is inspiring everyone friends it is true that today s era is of digital technology and e books but still books always play the role of a good friend in our lives hence we should motivate children to read books my family members it has been said in our scriptures jeeveshukarunachapi maitriteshuvidhiyatam that is have compassion on living beings and make them your friends most of our deities carriers are animals and birds many people visit temples to have darshan of god but they do not pay much attention to the animals that transport them these creatures should not only remain at the centre of our faith we should also protect them in every possible way during the last few years in the country a commendable rise has been observed in the numbers of lions tigers leopards and elephants many other efforts are also going on continuously to save other animals living on this earth a similar unique effort is also being undertaken in pushkar rajasthan here sukhdev bhatt ji and his team are working together to save wild animals and do you know what the name of their team is his team s name is cobra this dangerous name is because his team also works to rescue deadly snakes in this area a large number of people are involved in this team who reach the spot on just a call and get involved in their mission sukhdevji has till now saved the lives of more than 30 thousand venomous snakes through this effort whereas this has reduced the danger to the people nature is also being conserved this team is also involved in the service ofailing animals friends auto driver m rajendra prasad ji is also doing a unique work in chennai tamil nadu he has been engaged in the service of pigeons for the last 25 30 years he himself has more than 200 pigeons in his house there itself he takes full care of every need of the birds like food water health etc he spends quite a lot of money on this but he is steadfast in his work friends seeing people doing such work with good intentions really gives a lot of satisfaction and a lot of joy if you also get information about some such unique efforts do share it my dear family members this azadikaamritkaal is also the period of duty for every citizen of the country only by performing our duties can we achieve our goals and reach our destination the sense of duty binds us all together in sambhal up the country has seen such an example of sense of duty which i want to share with you too just imagine more than 70 villages population of thousands and all the people coming together and uniting to achieve one goal this rarely happens but the people of sambhalhave done it together these people have set a wonderful example of public participation and collective effort actually decades ago there used to be a river named sot in this area originating from amroha and flowing through sambhal to badaun this river was once known as the life giver in this region water used to flow continuously in this river which was the main basis of farming for the farmers here with time the flow of the river reduced the paths through which the river flowed were encroached upon and this river became extinct in our country which considers the river as a mother the people of sambhal have resolved to bring back to life sotriver also in december last year more than 70 gram panchayats together started the work of rejuvenation of the sot river the people of gram panchayats also took government departments along with them you will be happy to know that in just the first six months of the year itself these people had restored more than a 100 kilometres of the river when the rainy season started the hard work of the people here bore fruit and the sot river was filled to the brim with water this has come as a huge occasion of happiness for the farmers here people have also planted more than 10 thousand bamboo saplingson the banks of the river so that her banks remain completely safe more than thirty thousand gambusia fish have also been released in the river water so that mosquitoes do not breed friends the example of the sot river tells us that if we are determined we can overcome the biggest challenges and bring about a big change by walking on the path of duty you too can become the medium of many such changes around you my family members when intentions are firm and there is a passion to learn something no work remains difficult smtshakuntalasardar of west bengal has proved this to be absolutely correct today she has become an inspiration for many other women shakuntalaji is a resident of shatanala village of jangal mahal for a long time her family used to earn their livelihood by working as laborers every day sheer survival was

am expressing mann ki baat at a time when corona is testing our patience it is testing the limits of all of us at enduring misery many of our near and dear ones have left us untimely after successfully confronting the first wave of corona the country was full of enthusiasm full of self confidence but this storm has shaken the country friends in the days gone by to tide over this crisis i had long deliberations with experts from myriad sectors people from our pharma industry vaccine manufacturers those connected with oxygen production experts from the medical field have put forth their valuable suggestions to the government this time for emerging victorious in this battle we have to accord priority to expert and scientific advice the government of india is applying its entire might to give a fillip to the endeavours of state governments the state governments too are trying their best to fulfill their responsibilities friends presently the country s doctors and health workers are waging a colossal battle against corona over the past one year they have undergone varied experiences joining us at the moment is the well known dr shashank joshi ji from mumbai dr shashank ji has immense grassroot level experience in the field of treatment of corona and allied research he has also been the dean of the indian college of physicians let s speak to dr shashank pm namaskar dr shashank ji dr shashank namaskar sir pm just recently had got an opportunity to speak to you i had liked the clarity in your thoughts i felt all citizens of the country should know about your thoughts from what we used to hear i present it before you in the form of a question dr shashank all of you are deeply involved at the moment in saving lives day and night first of all i d like you to tell people about the second wave how different it is medically what precautions are necessary dr shashank thank you sir this second deluge that has come in rapidly this virus is faster moving than the first wave but the good thing is that the recovery rate is higher and mortality rate pretty low there are 2 3 differences here the first is to an extent it has been observed in youth and children too and the symptoms like the earlier one breathlessness dry cough fever all these are there along with it loss of smell and taste are also there and people are a bit scared there is absolutely no need of being scared 80 to 90 percent people do not show any of these symptoms what they call mutation there s no need to be afraid of that these mutations keep on happening the way we change our clothes the virus keeps changing its colours hence there is nothing to fear and we shall overcome this wave too waves keep coming and going the virus keeps coming and going these are the various symptoms and we have to be alert medically covid has a 14 to 21 day s timetable in which we should avail of the doctor s advice pm dr shashank the analysis that you mentioned is interesting for me too i have received many letters containing numerous apprehensions of people regarding treatment the demand for certain medicines is very high that s why i want you to tell people about the treatment of covid as well dr shashank yes sir people start clinical treatment very late in the belief that the illness will subside on its own they believe in what they keep watching on their mobile feeds if they abide by information provided by the government they will not face these difficulties in covid the clinical treatment protocol has magnitude of three types light or mild covid medium or moderate covid and intense what is called severe covid in the case of mild covid we do oxygen monitoring pulse monitoring and fever monitoring if the fever rises sometimes we use medicines like paracetamol and one should consult a doctor in the case of moderate or severe covid it is extremely important to contact the doctor correct and inexpensive medicines are available steroids can save life inhalers can be given tablets can be given and along with that oxygen has to be administered there are many simple treatments available but often what is happening is there is a new experimental medicine called remdesivir but one thing about this medicine is that one has to stay 2 3 days lesser in the hospital and it aids in clinical recovery and this medicine too works only when it is taken in the first 9 10 days and it is to be taken only for five days the way people are running after remdesivir they should stop doing that this medicine has a limited role it should be taken only when people are put on oxygen in a hospital strictly as per the doctor s advice it is important for all people to understand this if we do pranayam our lungs will expand a bit and there s an injection available for thinning blood it is called heparin if these simple medicines are given 98 people recover so staying positive is very important it is imperative that treatment protocol is as per the doctor s advice and it is not at all required to run after all these expensive medications sir we have excellent treatments we have oxygen we have ventilator facilities we have everything sir whenever this medicine is available it should be given only to appropriate people on this many myths are doing the rounds sir i want to clarify that we have the world s best treatment available you will see that india has the best recovery rate if you compare europe america our patients are recovering through our treatment protocols pm dr shashank many thanks to you the pieces of information that dr shashank gave us are very important and useful for all of us friends i urge all of you if you need any information if you have any apprehension get the information only from the correct source you can consult your family doctor or doctors in the neighbourhood on the phone i am noticing that many of our doctors are taking upon themselves this responsibility on their own many doctors are providing information to people through social media they are counseling on phone and whatsapp many hospitals have websites where information is available there you can seek advice of doctors too this is commendable joining me is dr naveed nazeer shah from srinagar dr naveed is a professor at a government medical college in srinagar naveed ji has cured many a corona patient under his supervision in this holy month of ramzan dr naveed is performing his duty and has also taken out time to talk to us come let s speak to him pm naveed ji namaskar dr naveed namaskar sir pm dr naveed during these difficult times our listeners of mann ki baat have raised the question of panic management through your experience what will you answer them dr naveed see when corona began the first hospital in kashmir to be designated as covid hospital was our city hospital which comes under a medical college the atmosphere then was that of fear at least in people it was so they used to feel that perhaps if a person contracts covid it would be taken as a death sentence and amidst that the doctors and paramedical staff working at our hospital also underwent that sense of fear how will we face these patients aren t we at a risk of contracting the infection but as time passed we too observed that if we wear protective gear fully abide by precautions colllectively we too including our staff can stay safe as time passed by we kept on noticing that some patients or people who were ill were asymptomatic who displayed no symptoms of the infection we saw that close to 90 95 of the patients are those who recover without in medication thus with the passage of time the fear of corona in the minds of people largely reduced today what we refer to as the second wave that has come in this time there is no need to panic this time around too amidst this occurrence too if we adhere to the protective measures the sops such as wearing masks using hand sanitizers beyond that if we maintain physical distance and avoid social gathering we can carry on with our daily work and keep ourselves protected from this infection too modi ji dr naveed people have many questions regarding the vaccine too like how much protection we will get from the vaccine how assured we can feel after the vaccine tell us something about this listeners will be greatly benefitted dr naveed from the time since the corona infection has surfaced before us till today we don t have any effective treatment available we can fight this disease with only two things one is protective measures and we have already been saying that if we get some effective vaccine we can overcome this disease our country presently has two vaccines available covaccine and covishield which have been made here itself other companies too who have done their trials have found that its efficacy is more than 60 and if we talk of jammu kashmir till now 15 to 16 lakh people have taken the vaccine yes quite a few misconceptions or myths about this have come up on social media enumerating the side effects till now in our place no side effects have been found in vaccines that have been administered only things that are routinely associated with every vaccine someone getting fever ache in the entire body or getting pain locally where injection is applied we have seen such side effects in all patients we have not seen any gross adverse effect and yes secondly some people had the apprehension that after vaccination that is on getting the vaccine some people got positive in this companies themselves have given guidelines that if someone is vaccinated they may have infection they can get positive but the severity of the disease that is its intensity in such patients will not be so much that is they may get positive but the disease can not prove to be fatal in them so we should remove from our mind such misconception about the vaccine whosoever s turn comes because from 1st may vaccine administration programme for all those above 18 years in the entire country will begin it is an appeal to the people that come and get vaccinated and protect yourselves and overall our society and our community will be protected from covid 19 infection modi ji dr naveed many many thanks to you and best wishes to you for the pious month of ramazan dr naveed many many thanks modi ji friends in this period of corona crisis all are getting aware of the importance of vaccine so it is my appeal that don t get swayed by any rumour about the vaccine you all must be knowing that people above 45 years of age can benefit from the free vaccine that has been sent to all state governments by the government of india now from 1st may onwards the vaccine is going to be made available for every person above 18 years in the country now the corporate sector companies too will be able to participate in the programme of administering vaccine to their employees i also want to say that the programme of free vaccine by the government of india that is going on now will continue further too i appeal also to the states to extend the benefit of this free vaccine campaign of government of india to maximum number of the people of their state friends we all know how difficult mentally it is to take care of ourselves our family during disease but our nursing staff in hospitals has to do this very job continuously with so many patients at the same time this sense of service is a great strength of our society only a nurse can tell properly about the service and hard work of the nursing staff that is why in mann ki baat i have invited sister bhavana dhruv ji who is providing her services at b r ambedkar medical college in raipur she is taking care of several corona patients come let us talk to her modi ji namaskaar bhavana ji bhavana respected prime minister ji namaskar modi ji bhavana ji bhavan yes sir modi ji do tell the audience of mann ki baat how you have so many responsibilities in family so much multitasking and yet along with that you are working with corona patients the experience that you have with corona patients people of the country would definitely like to hear that because sisters nurses are closest to the patient for the longest duration so they can understand every aspect in great detail please tell us bhavana yes sir my total experience in covid is 2 months we do our duties for 14 days and after that we are given rest then after 2 months our covid duties are repeated sir when i was put on covid duty for the first time first of all i shared this covid duty part with my family members this was in may and as i shared this all got scared worried they started telling me that i should work with care it was an emotional situation sir when my daughter asked me mamma you are going for covid duty it was a very emotional moment for me but when i went near a covid patient i had left a responsibility at home and when i met covid patients sir they were much more frightened than them all the patients were so frightened by the name covid that they were not able to understand what was happening to them or what we would do further to remove their fear we gave them a very healthy environment when we were told to do covid duty first of all we were asked to wear a ppe kit which is quite difficult to do duty with the ppe kit on sir this was very tough for us in 2 months duty i have worked everywhere 14 14 days duty in wards in icu in isolation modi ji that means in all you have been doing this very work for the past one year bhavana yes sir before going there i did not know who my colleagues were i worked as a team member whatever problem they had i shared i came to know about the patients and removed their stigma there were many people who were frightened of even the name of covid they showed all symptoms when we used to take their history but because of fear they wouldn t be able to get their test done then we would counsel them and sir when severity would increase by then their lungs would have already been infected by the time they came they would need icu by then and with them their entire family would come so i have seen 1 2 such cases sir and not just that i have worked with all age groups in that were small kids ladies men senior citizens all kinds of patients sir when we talked to them they said that they did not come because of fear we got the same answer from all then we counselled them sir that there is nothing to fear just follow us we will support you follow whatever protocol is there we could do only this much for them modi ji bhavana ji i felt nice talking to you you have given me quite good information you have shared by your experience definitely this will send a message of positivity to the countrymen many many thanks to you bhavana

25-Aug-19,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on August 25, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the diversity and richness of Indian festivals, emphasizing the timeless relevance of Lord Krishna's life and teachings.

namaskar on the one hand these days our country is enjoying the feast of rains on the other every corner of the country is celebrating festivals and fairs and this will go on till diwali perhaps our ancestors intricately wove the annual seasonal cycle the economy cycle and social life systems in a way that ensured that under no circumstances dullness crept into society we celebrated quite a few festivals in the days gone by yesterday krishna janma mahotsav the festival of the birth of lord krishna was celebrated throughout india can anyone even imagine the greatness of his personality that even after thousands of years the festival comes along with renewed novelty a new inspiration with fresh energy and the noble being that he was although millennia ago yet it is relevant in providing solutions to problems as well as inspiration even today everyone can find solutions to present day problems from shri krishna s life despite the tremendous might that he possessed there were times when he would immerse himself in performing the raas at other times he would be in the midst of cows and cowherds sometimes indulging in sports games often playing the flute a personality brimming with diverse talents and immense capability yet devoted to empowering society and people a persona that embodied pioneering accomplishments a repository a savior of people what qualities should the virtue of friendship possess who can forget the incident of sudama and on the battlefield despite his myriad facets of greatness assuming the role of a charioteer or running errands such as lifting a hillock or at other times picking up leftover leaf plates one feels a sense of newness in whatever he does and that s why today as i converse with you my attention is drawn towards two mohans one is the sudarshan chakra bearing mohan and the other is the charkha bearing mohan the sudarshan chakra bearing mohan left the banks of the yamuna for the sea beach of gujarat establishing himself in the city of dwarika while the mohan born on the sea beach reached the banks of the yamuna breathing his last in delhi sudarshan chakra bearing mohan thousands of years ago had amply used his wisdom his sense of duty his might his worldview to avert war to prevent conflict a sign of the times then and spinning wheel bearing mohan too chose a similar path for the sake of freedom for preserving human values for strengthening the basic elements of personality character for this he lent a certain hue to the freedom struggle a turn that left the whole world awe struck which it still remains today the importance of selfless service the importance of knowledge or be it marching ahead smilingly amidst the trials and tribulations of life we can learn all these from lord krishna s life s message and that is why shri krishna is known as jagatguru teacher to the world krishnam vande jagadgurum today as we discuss festivities preparations are under way for a mega festival in india not just in india it is a part of the discourse in the whole world my dear countrymen i m referring to the 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi on the 2nd of october 1869 at the beach of porbandar in kirti mandir as it is known today in that tiny abode not just a person an era was born that charted the course of human history on an altogether new path with trail blazing accomplishments on the way one attribute has always been part parcel of mahatma gandhi s being and that was his sense of service and the sense of duty towards it if you view his life in entirety you will note that he served communities in south africa that were bearing the brunt of apartheid in those times it was by no means a small feat he served farmers in champaran who were being discriminated against he served millworkers who were being underpaid he served the poor the destitute the weak and the hungry he took it as life s prime duty there were many myths associated with leprosy then in order to dispel them he closely served people suffering from leprosy he presented shining examples through the medium of service in his own life he set examples of the sense of service for others to learn not through words but through deeds gandhiji shared an unbreakable bond with truth he shared a similar unique bond with the spirit of service whoever needed him and wherever gandhiji was present to serve he emphasized not only on the spirit of service but also on the inner happiness it led to service as a virtue is meaningful when it is performed with a sense of joy seva parmo dharmah but simultaneously deep inner joy the essence of swantah sukhaayah is inbuilt in the spirit of service we can understand this from bapu s life mahatma gandhi of course became the voice of innumerable indians in the larger backdrop of upholding human values human dignity in a way he had become the voice of the world for mahatma gandhi the individual and society human beings humanity was everything whether it was the phoenix farm or the tolstoy farm in africa the sabarmati ashram or wardha he laid special emphasis on community mobilization in his own distinct way i have been extremely fortunate to have been blessed with the opportunity to visit a number of significant places associated with revered mahatma gandhi and pay my homage i can say that gandhi emphasized on the spirit of collectiveness through a sense of service community service and community mobilization are virtues which we have to imbibe into our real lives this would be the real way of paying true tributes to mahatma gandhi the karyanjali the offering of deeds opportunities like these come often we get associated with them but should gandhi 150 just come go will it be acceptable to us no dear countrymen all of us should introspect dwell upon it discuss it bring it into collective discourse joining hands with more people of the society from all strata from all age groups people from villages cities men women we should ask ourselves as an individual what can i add to the effort what value addition could be there from my side and being collective acquires its own strength in all the programmes of gandhi 150 let there be a sense of collectiveness let there be a spirit of service why don t we join hands and let the entire neighbourhood move together if there is a football team then the entire team of course we ll play football but along with it we ll pick up a deed to perform in conformity with one of gandhi s ideals of service there could be a ladies club routine tasks of a modern day ladies club shall be taken up but besides that let all members of the ladies club come together perform an activity of service we can do a lot collect old books distribute them amongst the poor spread the glow of knowledge and i do believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen are endowed with 130 crore ideas there could be 130 crore endeavours there is no limit whatever that comes to your mind but only with a genuine wish a noble intention within the realms of harmony and with complete dedication that too for the sake of enjoying that rare inner bliss the core of swaantah sukhaayah my dear countrymen a few months ago i was in dandi in our freedom struggle the salt satyagrah at dandi was an important turning point there i d inaugurated a state of the art museum dedicated to mahatma gandhi i sincerely urge you to visit at least one place associated with mahatma gandhi in the days to come it could be any site such as porbandar sabarmati ashram champaran the ashram at wardha or spots in delhi related to mahatma gandhi when you visit them do share your photographs on social media so that others may be inspired and do pen a couple of sentences or couplets to express your feelings emotions that emanate from the core of your heart will be more compelling than any great literary composition and it is possible that in present times from your viewpoint the pen picture of gandhi sketched by you may perhaps appear more relevant in the times to come many programmes competitions exhibitions have been planned in this context i feel like sharing with you something very interesting there is a famous art show called the venice biennale where people from the world over congregate this time in the india pavilion at the venice biennale a very interesting exhibition based on memories of gandhiji was organized of special interest were the haripura panels you may remember that in the haripura congress session in gujarat subhash chandra bose being elected as president is recorded in history these art panels have a beautiful past before the haripura session in 1937 38 mahatma gandhi had invited the then principal of shantiniketan kala bhavan nandlal bose it was gandhiji s wish that the lifestyle of the people of india be depicted through the medium of art and this artwork may be exhibited during the session this is the same nandlal bose whose artwork adorns our constitution lends to the constitution a new unique identity the very commitment reverence of nandlal bose have made him along with the constitution immortal nandlal bose toured villages around haripura concluding with a few works of art canvas depicting glimpses of life in rural india this invaluable artwork was a high point of discourse at venice once again along with greetings on gandhiji s 150th birth anniversary i express my expectations from every indian of one resolve or the other one should do something for the sake of the country society or just for someone else this will be a good true genuine karyanjali to bapu a tribute through a good deed o glorious children of mother india you may remember that for the last few years we have been running a countrywide campaign swachchata hi sewa the quest for cleanliness is service around a couple of weeks before the 2nd of october this time around it will commence on the 11th of september during this period all of us will move out of home donating toil sweat through shramdaan as a karyanjali to mahatma gandhi home or the neighbourhood lane street circles crossings or drains schools and colleges we have to involve ourselves in a mega campaign of ensuring cleanliness at public places this time our emphasis must be on plastic on 15th august i had urged you from the red fort the way one hundred twenty five crore countrymen ran a campaign for cleanliness with utmost enthusiasm and energy and toiled tirelessly towards freedom from open defecation in a similar manner we have to join hands in curbing single use plastic this campaign has enthused people from all strata of society many of my merchant brothers sisters have put up a placard at their establishments boldly mentioning that customers ought to carry shopping bags with them this will result in monetary savings as well as one would be able to contribute towards protection of the environment this year on the 2nd of october when we celebrate bapu s 150th birth anniversary we shall not only dedicate to him an india that is open defecation free but also shall lay the foundation of a new revolution against plastic by people themselves throughout the country i appeal to all strata of society residents of every village town city take it as a prayer with folded hands let us celebrate gandhi jayanti this year as a mark of our plastic free mother india let us celebrate 2nd october as a special day let us celebrate mahatma gandhi s birth anniversary as a special shramdaan festival where everyone will donate one s own labour i urge all municipalities municipal corporations district administration gram panchayats government non governmental bodies organizations in fact each every citizen to work towards ensuring adequate arrangement for collection storage of plastic waste i also appeal to the corporate sector to come out with ways means proactively for appropriate disposal of all accumulated plastic it can be recycled it can be transformed into fuel this way we can accomplish our task of ensuring safe disposal of plastic waste before this diwali all that is needed is a resolve and for inspiration there s no need to look hither tither what can be a greater inspiration than gandhi my dear countrymen our sanskrit subhashit epigrammatic verses are in a way gems of wisdom we can derive from them whatever we need in life these days i m not in regular touch with the form earlier it was frequent today i want to touch upon a very important point from a sanskrit subhashit these lines were written centuries ago but even today carry great relevance there is an excellent subhashit that mentions that is water grain and subhashit are the three gems found on earth imprudent people call stones as gems in our culture much glory has been ascribed to food we have even converted the knowledge about food into a science balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us more so for women and the new born since these two categories are the foundation of the future of our society under the poshan abhiyaan campaign nutrition made available with the help of modern scientific methods is being converted into a mass movement all over the country people are fighting a battle against malnutrition in innovative and interesting ways once an interesting fact was brought to my notice the mutthi bhar dhaanya initiative has turned into a big movement in nashik in this novel scheme during the harvest period anganwadi workers collect a handful of rice grain from the people this grain is used to make piping hot food for children and women in this way the person contributing the handful of grain transmutes into a conscientious civil social worker in the process he gets himself dedicated to this cause and becomes a soldier of that movement all of us have heard about the ann praashan sanskar the first solid morsel ritual for toddlers in families all across india this ritual is performed when the toddler starts feeding on solid food for the first time solid and not liquid food in 2010 gujarat embarked upon planning to provide kids complimentary food on the occasion of ann praashan sanskar so that this initiative spreads awareness among the masses this is a great initiative that can be adopted anywhere in many states people run meal campaigns on certain dates if the family celebrates a birthday certain auspicious day or observe an in memoriam day then the family members with self prepared nutritious and delicious food go to the anganwadis and also to the schools and these family members themselves serve the children and feed them they not only share their happiness but in the process receive happiness magnified manifold there is a wonderful confluence of a sense of service and satisfaction my friends there are many little things that can be employed in our country s effective fight against malnutrition today due to lack of awareness both poor and affluent families are affected by malnutrition the month of september will be celebrated as poshan abhiyaan across the country you must get connected with it get information about this initiative add some new facet to poshan abhiyaan by contributing to it if you manage to save a few people from malnutrition it would mean that we can bring the country out of the circle of malnutrition srishti ji thank you for your phone call and just like you kk pandey ji from sohna haryana and aishwarya sharma from surat and many other people have expressed a desire to know more about the man vs wild television episode aired on discovery channel this time when i was thinking about mann ki baat i was sure that a lot of questions would crop up about this subject and that s what exactly happened in the last few weeks wherever i went and met people man vs wild gets a mention with this one episode i have not only formed a connect with the youth around the world but i had never thought that i would find a certain place in young hearts in this way i had never thought that the youth of our country and the world pay attention to diverse things i had never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of young people around the world and look what happens just last week i went to bhutan i have seen that whenever i have had the opportunity to go as prime minister and of course credit also goes to international yoga day the situation now is that wherever i go in the world or interact with someone people invariably spend close to 5 7 minutes asking questions on yoga there must hardly be a major world leader who has not discussed yoga with me and this has been my experience all over the world but these days i m experiencing something new whoever i meet or wherever there is a chance to talk the focus is on wildlife discussions about the environment the tiger the asiatic lion evolution etc and i am amazed how interested people are in nature the discovery channel plans to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their respective languages today when there is a global churning of thought on environment global warming and climate change i do hope that in such circumstances this episode of discovery channel will help greatly in familiarizing the world with the message from india the traditions of india and the empathy for nature in india s trail of glorious traditions it is my firm belief that people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in india but there is another interesting thing some people ask me one thing albeit with some hesitation modi ji you were speaking in hindi and bear grylls does not know hindi so how did you carry on such a fast conversation between the two of you was this episode edited later how many times did the shooting happen for this episode and how it happened they ask with great curiosity now there is no secret in this many people have this question in their minds so i will unravel this secret well in a way it is no secret at all the reality is that technology was used extensively in my conversation with bear grylls whenever i spoke immediately there was a simultaneous translation into english or simultaneous interpretation and bear grylls had a small cordless instrument in his ear so i used to speak in hindi but he heard it in english and because of that the communication became very easy and this is an amazing aspect about technology after the broadcast of this show a large number of people have been discussing about jim corbett national park you must also visit sites associated with nature and wild life and animals as i have said before and i emphasize that you must visit the north east in your lifetime what a glorious abundance of nature exists there you will be left wonderstruck your horizon will expand on 15th august i urged all of you from the ramparts of the red fort to visit at least 15 places within a span of the next 3 years 15 places within india and for 100 tourism visit these 15 sites witness and observe do take the family and spend some time there our country is full of diversity and this wide range of diversity will also inculcate variations within you as a teacher your life will be enriched your thinking will expand and trust me there are places within india from where you will come back with renewed energy enthusiasm zeal and inspiration and maybe you will feel like returning to certain places again and again your family too would feel the same my dear countrymen the concern and care for the environment in india seems natural last month i had the privilege of releasing the tiger census in the country do you know how many tigers there are in india the tiger population in india is 2967 two thousand nine hundred sixty seven a few years ago we were with great difficulty at a figure half of what we have at present the tiger summit took place in 2010 at st petersburg russia at this summit a resolution was taken expressing concern about the dwindling tiger population in the world it was resolved to double the number of tigers worldwide by 2022 but this is new india where we accomplish goals in the quickest time possible we doubled our tiger numbers in 2019 itself not only the tiger population in india was doubled but the number of protected areas and community reserves has also increased at the time i was releasing the data on tigers i also remembered the asiatic lion of the gir in gujarat i had the charge of the chief minister of gujrat at a period of time when the habitat of lions in the forests of gir was shrinking their number was decreasing we took several innovative steps one after the other in the gir in 2007 it was decided to deploy female guards there were improvements in the infrastructure to increase tourism whenever we talk about nature and wildlife we only talk about conservation but we now have to move beyond conservation and think about compassion our scriptures have provided great guidance with respect to this subject our scriptures have said centuries ago that is if there are no forests tigers are forced to venture into the human habitat and are killed and if there are no tigers in the forest then man cuts the forest and destroys it so in fact the tiger protects the forest and not that the forest protects the tiger our forefathers explained this great truth in a befitting manner therefore we need to not only conserve our forests flora and fauna but also create an environment wherein they can flourish properly my dear countrymen who can forget the historic speech of swami vivekananda delivered on september 11 1893 this young monk of india who shook the conscience of the human race of the entire world imparted onto this world a glorious identity of india the enslaved india which was gazed at by the world in a much distorted manner was forced to change its way of looking at india due to the words of a great man like swami vivekananda on september 11 1893 come let us look anew at india which swami vivekananda had seen and let us put in practice the inherent strength of india realized by swami vivekananda we possess everything within us let us proceed with confidence my dear countrymen all of you will remember that the 29th of august is celebrated as national sports day on this occasion we are going to launch the fit india movement across the country we have to keep ourselves fit and the nation has to be made fit it will be a very interesting campaign for everyone children the elderly the young and women and it will be your own movement but today i am not going to reveal its specifics you must wait for 29thaugust i will tell you about fit india movement in detail on 29thaugust and i am not going to forget connecting you with the movement because i want to see you fit i want to make you aware about fitness and for a fit india we should unite to set some goals for the country my dear countrymen i will be waiting for your participation on 29th august in fit india movement in poshan abhiyaan during the month of september and especially in the swachhata abhiyan beginning from the 11th of september to the 2nd of october and 2nd october as a day has been totally dedicated to riddance from plastic all of us with all our might must try to get rid of plastics from our home and everywhere outside our houses and i know that all these campaigns will make a big splash on social media come let us proceed with a new zeal new resolve and renewed strength my dear countrymen this is all that this episode of mann ki baat has in store for you today i shall be meeting you later i will wait for your say and your suggestions come let us all march together to make the india which was dreamt of by our freedom fighters and realize gandhi s dreams swantah sukhayah let us proceed enjoying our inner bliss expressing our spirit of service many many thanks namaskar pm pm pm mannkibaat single use plastic pm mannkibaat pm mannkibaat pm mannkibaat man vs wild episode pm mannkibaat during today s mannkibaat i have made some requests to my fellow indians visit iconic places relating to bapu as a part of his 150th jayanti travel to places related to nature and wildlife strengthen poshan abhiyan be a part of fit india movement ,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on August 25, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the diversity and richness of Indian festivals, emphasizing the timeless relevance of Lord Krishna's life and teachings. He also highlighted Mahatma Gandhi's upcoming 150th birth anniversary and encouraged citizens to engage in acts of selfless service as a tribute to him. "
25-Dec-16,"In his December 25, 2016, address, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended Christmas greetings and paid tribute to Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on their respective birth anniversaries. He introduced two new government schemes aimed at promoting digital payments in India: ""Lucky Grahak Yojana"" for consumers and ""Digi Dhan Vyapaar Yojana"" for traders. The schemes offered rewards for digital transactions and were part of the effort to make India a cashless economy. Modi emphasized the importance of connecting every segment of society to the digital payment system, including the rural population. He discussed the significance of the fight against corruption and black money and urged citizens to report wrongdoings. He also mentioned the recently passed law to benefit differently-abled individuals, which expands opportunities for them in employment and education. Modi congratulated the Indian cricket and hockey teams for their impressive performances, and he wished all Indians a joyful and successful 2017.",25-dec-2016 my fellow countrymen namaskar many felicitations and season s greetings to you on the occasion of christmas today is the day to give importance in our lives to service sacrifice and compassion jesus had said the poor do not need our favours but our acceptance with affection in the gospel according to saint luke it is written that jesus not only served the poor but also praised the service done by the poor and this is what real empowerment is a tale associated with this incident is also very popular it has been mentioned in that story that jesus was standing near the treasury of a temple many rich people came and donated bountifully then a poor widow came and parted with only two copper coins now just two copper coins really do not amount to much thus it was natural that there was a lot of curiosity in the minds of the disciples gathered there then jesus declared that the widow was the greatest of those donors because while the others had donated substantially that widow had given away all she possessed today 25th december is also the birth anniversary of mahamana madan mohan malviyaji who kindled resolve and self confidence in the psyche of the indian people and gave a new direction to modern education my most sincere and heartfelt tributes to malviyaji on his birth anniversary about two days ago i had the opportunity to launch many a developmental work in banaras the sacred workplace of malviyaji i also laid the foundation stone of mahamana madan mohan malviya cancer centre in bhu at varanasi this cancer centre is going to be a boon for the people of not only eastern uttar pradesh but for the people of jharkhand and bihar also today is also the birthday of bharat ratna and former prime minister venerable atal bihari vajpayee ji this country can never forget atalji s contributions under his leadership the country proudly grew in stature in the field of nuclear power also whether in the role of a party leader member of parliament a minister or the prime minister atalji always established an ideal i salute atalji on his birthday and pray to god for his good health as a party worker i had the privilege of working with atalji many memories emerge before my eyes this morning when i tweeted i shared a video in which you can see for yourself how as a small party worker one had the fortune of having affection showered upon him by atalji today on christmas day as a gift the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes in a way it is the beginning of two new schemes throughout the entire country be it villages or towns the educated or the illiterate there is an atmosphere of curiosity as to what is cashless how cashless business can take place how can one make purchases without using cash everybody wants to understand and learn from each other to encourage this trend to strengthen mobile banking and to inculcate the habit of making e payments the government of india is launching from today encouragement schemes for consumers as well as traders to encourage customers the scheme is lucky grahak yojana and to encourage traders the scheme is digi dhan vyapaar yojana today on 25th december as a christmas gift fifteen thousand people will get rewards through a draw system whereby each of the fifteen thousand winners will have one thousand rupees into their accounts and this will be not for today only starting today this scheme will continue for the next 100 days everyday fifteen thousand people are going to receive rewards of one thousand rupees each in the next 100 days lakhs of families are going to receive crores of rupees as gift but you will be entitled to this gift only if you make use of mobile banking e banking rupay card upi ussd such means and methods of digital payment the draw for rewards will be done based on your use of such digital payment methods in addition there would be a grand draw once every week for such customers in which the prize money will be in lakhs of rupees and three months later on april 14th on the occasion of the birth anniversary of dr baba saheb ambedkar there would be a mega bumper draw where rewards would be in crores of rupees digi dhan vyapar yojana is mainly for traders and businessmen traders should adopt this scheme themselves and should encourage their customers too in order to make their business cashless such traders will also be rewarded separately and there would be thousands of these rewards the traders will run their business activities smoothly and will also have an opportunity to win rewards this scheme has been designed keeping all sections of society in mind with a special focus on the poor and the lower middle class segments therefore only those will get its benefits who make a purchase worth more than 50 rupees but less than three thousand rupees those who make purchases of more than three thousand rupees will not be entitled to rewards under this scheme even the poor people can use ussd on simple feature or ordinary mobile phones to buy and sell goods as well as make payments and thus all of them can also become prospective beneficiaries of this reward scheme in rural areas too people can buy or sell through aeps and they can also win rewards many will be surprised to know that now there are about 30 crore i e 300 million rupay cards in india out of which 200 million rupay cards belong to poor families which have jan dhan accounts these 300 million people can immediately become part of this rewards scheme i have confidence that the countrymen will evince interest in this system and if you enquire from the young people around you they would surely be aware of these things and on your asking will tell you about these come on if there is a child studying in 10th or 12th standard in your family he or she will also be able to teach you well about this it is as simple as sending whatsapp messages on the mobile my dear countrymen i feel delighted to learn that the awareness about how to use technology making e payments making online payments is spreading very fast during the past few days the cashless transactions or cashless trading has increased by 200 to 300 to give cashless trading a big impetus government of india has taken a very major decision the business community our traders can well comprehend how momentous this decision is those businessmen who adopt digital transactions who develop online payment process instead of cash transactions in their trade activities will get income tax rebate i congratulate all the states and union territories who have promoted this campaign in their own way the chief minister of andhra pradesh mr chandrababu naidu is the head of a committee which is considering various schemes under this however i have seen that the governments also have initiated and implemented many schemes i ve been told that assam government has decided to grant a 10 discount on property tax and business license fee if payments are made through digital transaction the branches of grameen that is rural banks there getting 75 of their customers to make at least two digital transactions between january and march will get 50 thousands rupees rewards from the government they have announced that under the uttam panchayat for digi transaction rewards of 5 lakh rupees will be given to villages doing 100 digital transaction till 31st march 2017 assam government has decided to reward 5 thousand rupees to the first 10 farmers as digital krishak shiromani who will buy seeds and fertilizers entirely through digital payments i congratulate assam government and also all those state governments who have taken such initiatives a number of organisations have also successfully carried out many experiments to promote digital transactions amongst the rural folk and poor farmers i have been told that gnfc or gujarat narmada valley fertilizers chemicals limited which primarily manufactures fertilizers has installed a thousand pos machines for sale of fertilizers for the convenience of farmers and in just a few days 35 thousand farmers were sold 5 lakh sacs of fertilizers on digital payment and this was accomplished in only two weeks and the interesting fact is that compared to last year the fertilizer sales of gnfc have gone up by 27 percent brothers and sisters the informal sector occupies a major segment in our economy and in our pattern of life and mostly these people are paid wages for their labour and hard work in cash they are paid their salaries in cash and we know that due to this they are exploited also if they are to receive 100 rupees they get only 80 rupees if they are to be paid 80 rupees they are given only 50 rupees they are deprived of facilities like insurance and those associated with health sector but now the practice of cashless payment is being adopted the money is being directly deposited into banks in a way the informal sector is getting converted into the formal sector exploitation is coming to an end the cut which had to be paid earlier has stopped now and it has become possible for the worker the artisan such poor persons to get their full amount of money in addition they are also becoming entitled to the other benefits due to them our country is blessed with the maximum number of young people thus we are favourably placed for using technology a country like india should be ahead of everybody else in this field our youth have benefitted quite a lot from start ups this digital movement is a golden opportunity for our youth they should impart to this as much strength as they can with their new ideas technology and processes but we must also connect with the drive to rid the country of black money and corruption with all our might my dear countrymen i request every month before mann ki baat that you please give your suggestions share your thoughts and of the thousands of such suggestions received this time on mygov on narendramodiapp i can definitely say that 80 to 90 suggestions were pertaining to the war against corruption and black money there was mention of demonetization after i examined all the suggestions i can say that these can macroscopically be roughly divided into three categories some have written in detail about people facing difficulties and encountering inconveniences the other group of correspondents have stressed that this is such a good work being carried out for the welfare of the country such a sacred task but they have also noted that in spite of this there are many scams being committed and new avenues of dishonesty are being explored the third group is the one which has while wholeheartedly supporting the action being taken clearly stressed that this fight must be carried forward corruption and black money must be completely destroyed and if this requires even more tough steps to be taken those must be taken we have many people writing this most emphatically i am thankful to the countrymen for helping me by writing these innumerable letters to me shriman gurumani kewal has written on mygov this step of reigning in black money is praiseworthy we citizens are facing some difficulties but we are all fighting against corruption and we are happy that we are making a contribution in this fight we are battling corruption black money etc on the lines of military forces the sentiment behind gurumani kewalji s text is being echoed in every nook and corner of the country all of us are experiencing it when the people face problems undergo hardships rare will be a fellow human being who will not empathise i feel as much pain as you do but when a task is taken up with a noble objective to realise a lofty intent with a clear conscience the countrymen stay firm courageously amidst all these trials and tribulations these people are the real agents of change pioneers of transformation i thank people for one more reason they have not only braved hardships but have also powerfully given a retort to those limited few who have been trying to mislead them so many rumours were spread even the fight against corruption and black money was sought to be tainted with shades of communalism somebody spread a rumour that the spelling on the currency note was faulty someone said salt prices had spiraled someone proclaimed that the 2000 rupee note would also be withdrawn even 500 and 100 rupee denominations notes were rumoured to be on their way out but i have seen that despite rampant rumour mongering citizens have stood firm with their faith intact and not just that many people came to the fore and through their creativity and intelligence exposed the rumour mongers brought out the falsity of the rumours and established the truth i salute this great ability of the people also from the core of my heart my dear countrymen i am experiencing one thing every moment when a hundred and twenty five crore countrymen are standing by you nothing is impossible the people represent the will of the almighty and their blessings become his blessings i thank the people of this country and salute them for participating in this mahayagya against black money and corruption with utmost zeal it was my earnest wish that the ongoing campaign against corruption and black money including the realm of political parties and political funding be discussed extensively in the parliament had the house functioned properly there would have been comprehensive deliberation some people are spreading rumours that political parties enjoy all kinds of concessions these people are absolutely in the wrong the law applies equally to all whether it is an individual an organisation or a political party everyone has to abide by law and one will have to people who cannot endorse corruption and black money openly resort to searching for faults of the government relentlessly another issue which comes up is this why are rules changed time and again this government is for the sake of the people the government continuously endeavours to take a feedback from them what are the areas of difficulty for the people what are the rules that are creating hindrances and what are the possible solutions the government being a sensitive government amends rules as required keeping the convenience of the people as its foremost consideration so that citizens are not subjected to hardships on the other hand as i d said earlier on the 8th to be precise this drive this war is an extraordinary one for the past 70 years what kind of forces are involved in this murky enterprise of perfidy and corruption how mighty are they when i have resolved to wage battle against them they too come up with new tactics everyday to thwart the government s efforts to counter these new offensives we too have to devise appropriate new responses and antidotes when the opponents keep on trying out new tactics we have to counteract decisively since we have resolved to eradicate the corrupt shady businesses and black money on the other hand many people have mentioned in their letters all kinds of wrongdoing which are going on how newer wily ways and means are being devised in this context i offer my heartiest salutations to my dear countrymen for one very remarkable thing these days you must be seeing on t v and newspapers everyday many new people are being taken into custody currency notes are being seized raids are being carried out influential persons are being caught how has all this been made possible should i let out the secret the secret is that my sources of such information are people themselves information being received from common citizens is many times higher than that being obtained through government machinery and we are by and large being successful in our operations on account of the awareness and alertness that the people have displayed can anyone imagine the level of risk which the aware citizen of my country is taking to expose such elements the information received has largely proved to be fruitful for those of you wanting to share such information you can send it on an e mail address set up by the government for this purpose you can also provide it on mygov the government is committed to fight all such wrongdoings and maladies and when we have your active support this fight becomes much easier thirdly there is another group of letter writers also existing in large numbers they say modiji do not feel exhausted do not stop and take the most stringent measures that you can now that you have chosen this path the journey should culminate at its intended and logical destination i specially thank writers of such letters since their writing exudes a certain confidence fortified with blessings i sincerely assure you that this is in no way going to be a full stop this is just the beginning we have to win this battle and the question of feeling exhausted or stopping simply does not arise armed with the good wishes of a hundred and twenty five crore countrymen there is no question of a retreat you are possibly aware of a law about benami property in our country which came into being in 1988 but neither were its rules ever framed nor was it notified it just lay dormant gathering dust we have retrieved it and turned it into an incisive law against benami property in the coming days this law will also become operational for the benefit of the nation for the benefit of the people whatever needs to be done will be accorded our top priority my dear countrymen i had mentioned in last month s mann ki baat that even amidst these hardships our farmers toiled tirelessly and broke last year s record in sowing it is a sign of good times for the agricultural sector the diligent hard work by this country s workers and farmers and youth has scripted a new chapter of success with flying colours recently india proudly inscribed her name in various sectors of the global economic scenario it is solely on account of the tireless exertions of our countrymen that on myriad indicators india has charted an upward trajectory in global rankings india s ranking has gone up in the doing business report of the world bank we are trying our best to raise the level of the business practices in india to match the best practices in the world on equal footing and we are succeeding in that in the world investment report released by unctad india s position has risen to third in the top prospective host economies for 2016 18 in the global competitive report of the world economic forum india has made a big leap upwards by 32 ranks in the global innovation index 2016 we have moved up 16 rungs and in the logistics performance index 2016 of the world bank we have risen by 19 ranks there are many reports whose evaluation indicate that india is taking rapid strides ahead my dear countrymen this time the session of parliament became the object of ire of our countrymen indignation was expressed everywhere about the activities in the parliament the president and vice president also explicitly expressed their displeasure but even in such a situation sometimes good things also take place which create a sense of satisfaction in the mind amid the din in parliament an excellent task was accomplished which has not attracted due attention of the country brothers and sisters today with pride and joy i would like to mention that a bill in connection with my government s mission on divyangjan that is differently or specially abled people was passed in parliament for this i extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of lok sabha and rajya sabha on behalf of millions of divyangjan of the country i express my thanks our government is committed to the welfare of divyaangs personally too i have strived to lend momentum to this campaign my intention was to ensure that the divyangjan secure their due rights and also the honour and dignity that they are entitled to our efforts and our trust were fortified by our divyaang brothers and sisters when they returned with 4 medals from the paralympics with their triumph not only did they do the nation proud they pleasantly surprised many people through their capabilities and prowess our divyaang brothers and sisters are an invaluable heritage a precious endowment just as every citizen of the country is today i am immensely delighted that the passing of this law for the welfare of the divyaangjan will open up additional avenues of employment for them in government jobs the extent of reservation for them has been enhanced to 4 special provisions have been provided for in this law for their education facilities and also for grievances the extent of sensitivity of the government towards the divyaangs can be assessed by the fact that during the last two years the central government set up 4350 camps for divyaangs spent 352 crore rupees for distributing implements to 5 80 000 divyaang brothers and sisters the government has passed the new law in consonance with the spirit expressed by the united nations earlier there were seven divyaang categories now adding fourteen new categories this has been expanded to twenty one categories many such new categories of divyaangs have been included thereby providing them for the first time justice and opportunities for example categories like thalassemia parkinson s or for that matter dwarfism have been included my young friends during the last few weeks news items coming in from the world of sports have made all of us proud being indians it is but natural for us to feel elated in the cricket series against england india has triumphed 4 0 in this the performance of some of the younger players deserves a special word of praise the young karun nair scored a triple century and k l rahul played a brilliant

heights make this event a mass movement my dear countrymen today the festival of christmas is also being celebrated with great fervour all over the world it is a day to remember the life and teachings

took time out to visit the pm museum she liked atal ji s gallery very much in this museum the picture clicked there with atal ji has become memorable for her in atal ji s gallery we can have a glimpse of his valuable contribution to the country be it infrastructure education or foreign policy he strove to take india to new heights in every field i once again solemnly bow to atal ji from the core of my heart friends tomorrow the 26th of december is veer bal diwas and i will have the privilege of participating in a programme dedicated to the martyrdom of sahibzada zorawar singh ji and sahibzada fateh singh ji in delhi on this occasion the country will always remember the sacrifice of sahibzade and mata gujri my dear countrymen it is said here satyam kim pramanam pratyaksham kim pramanam that is truth does not require proof what is evident also does not require proof but when it comes to modern medical science the most important thing is evidence lack of evidence based research in the context of our scriptures like yoga and ayurveda has always been a challenge which has been a part of indian life for centuries results are visible but evidence is not but i am happy that in the era of evidence based medicine yoga and ayurveda are now standing up to the touchstone of tests of the modern era all of you must have heard about the tata memorial center in mumbai this institute has earned a name for itself in research innovation and cancer care an intensive research done by this center has revealed that yoga is very effective for breast cancer patients tata memorial center has presented the results of its research in the very prestigious breast cancer conference held in america these results have attracted the attention of the world s biggest experts because tata memorial center has conveyed with evidence how patients have benefited from yoga according to the research of this center regular practice of yoga has reduced the risk of recurrence and death of breast cancer patients by 15 percent this is the first example of indian traditional medicine being tested vis a vis the stringent standards of western methods also this is the first study in which yoga has been found to improve the quality of life in women affected by breast cancer its long term benefits have also come to the fore the tata memorial center has presented the results of its study at the european society of medical oncology conference in paris friends in today s era the more evidence based indian medical systems are the more their acceptance will increase in the whole world with this thought an effort is also being made in delhi s aiims here the center for integrative medicine and research was established six years ago to validate our traditional medical practices latest modern techniques and research methods are used in this the center has already published 20 papers in reputed international journals a paper published in the journal of the american college of cardiology describes the benefits of yoga for patients suffering from syncope similarly in a paper of neurology journal in migraine the benefits of yoga have been explained apart from these studies are being done regarding the benefits of yoga in many other diseases as well like heart disease depression sleep disorder and problems faced by women during pregnancy friends a few days ago i was in goa for the world ayurveda congress delegates from more than 40 countries participated in it and more than 550 scientific papers were presented here around 215 companies from around the world including india displayed their products in the exhibition here in this expo which went on for four days more than one lakh people enjoyed their experience related to ayurveda even in the ayurveda congress i reiterated the point for evidence based research to the ayurveda experts gathered from all over the world the way we all are seeing the power of yoga and ayurveda in this time of the corona global pandemic evidence based research related to these will prove to be very significant i also urge you that if you have any information about such efforts related to yoga ayurveda and our traditional treatment methods then do share them on social media my dear countrymen in the last few years we have overcome many major challenges related to the health sector full credit for this goes to the willpower of our medical experts scientists and countrymen we have eradicated diseases like smallpox polio and guinea worm from india today i would like to tell the listeners of mann ki baat about another challenge which is now about to end this challenge this disease is kala azar the parasite of this disease is spread through the sting of the sand fly when someone has kala azar one has fever for months there is anemia the body becomes weak and the weight also decreases this disease can happen to anyone from children to elders but with everyone s efforts this disease named kala azar is now getting eradicated rapidly till recently the scourge of kala azar had spread in more than 50 districts across 4 states but now this disease is confined to only 4 districts of bihar and jharkhand i am sure the strength and awareness of the people of bihar jharkhand will help the government s efforts to eliminate kala azar from these four districts as well i also urge the people of kala azar affected areas to keep two things in mind one is control of sand fly and second diagnosis and complete treatment of this disease as soon as possible the treatment of kala azar is easy the medicines used for this are also very effective you just have to be alert do not be negligent if you have fever and also keep spraying medicines that kill the sand fly just think when our country will be free from kala azar it will be a matter of joy for all of us in this spirit of sab ka prayas we are also working towards eradication of t b in india by 2025 you must have seen in the recent past when the t b mukt bharat campaign started thousands of people came forward to help the t b patients these people as nikshay mitras are taking care of the patients helping them financially this power of public service and public participation achieves every difficult goal with certainty my dear countrymen our tradition and culture have an unbreakable connection with ma ganga ganga water has been an integral part of our way of life and it is also said in our scriptures namami gange tav paad pankajam sur asurai vandit divya roopam bhuktim cha muktim cha dadasi nityam bhaav anusaaren sadaa naraanaam meaning o mother ganga you bestow worldly happiness bliss and salvation on your devotees according to their wishes all worship your holy feet i also offer my salutations at your holy feet amid that it is a big responsibility of all of us to keep clean mother ganges that has been flowing for centuries with this objective eight years ago we started the namami gange campaign it is a matter of pride for all of us that today this initiative of india is getting appreciation from all over the world the united nations has included the namami gange mission in the world s top ten initiatives to restore the ecosystem it is even more heartening that namami gange has received this honor among 160 such initiatives from all over the world friends the biggest source of energy behind the namami gange campaign is the continuous participation of the people in the namamigange campaign ganga praharis and ganga doots also have a big role to play they are engaged in spreading awareness through planting trees cleaning ghats ganga aarti street plays painting and poems a lot of improvement is also being seen in biodiversity due to this campaign there has been a significant increase in the number of different species of hilsa fish gangetic dolphin and turtles with ganga s ecosystem being clean other livelihood opportunities are also increasing here i would like to discuss the jalaj ajeevika model which has been prepared keeping biodiversity in mind this tourism based boat safaris has been launched at 26 locations obviously the spread of the namami gange mission its scope has increased much more than the cleaning of the river whereas this evidence is direct proof of our willpower and tireless efforts on the other hand it is also going to show a new path to the world in the direction of environmental protection my dear countrymen when the power of our resolve is strong even the biggest challenge becomes easy the example of this has been set by sange sherpa ji of thegu village of sikkim for the last 14 years he is engaged in the work of environmental protection at an altitude of more than 12 000 feet sange ji has taken up the task of keeping clean the tsomgo somgo lake that is of cultural and mythological importance with his untiring efforts he has changed the look and feel of this glacier lake when sange sherpa ji started this campaign of cleanliness in the year 2008 he had to face many difficulties but within no time along with the youth and villagers the panchayat also started offering full support in this noble work today if you go to see the tsomgolake you will find huge garbage bins all around there now the garbage collected here is sent for recycling garbage bags made of cloth are also given to the tourists coming here so that the garbage is not strewn around now about 5 lakh tourists reach here every year to see this very clean lake sange sherpa has also been honored by many organizations for this unique effort to conserve tsomgo somgo lake due to such efforts today sikkim is counted among the cleanest states of india along with sange sherpa ji and his colleagues i also heartily appreciate the people engaged in the noble effort of environmental protection across the country friends i am happy that the swachh bharat mission has become firmly rooted in the mind of every indian today since the inception of this mass movement in the year 2014 to take it to new heights many unique efforts have been made by the people these efforts are being made not only within the society but also on part of the government the result of these continuous efforts is that due to the removal of garbage removal of unnecessary items a lot of space opens up in the offices new space is available earlier due to lack of space offices had to be maintained on rent at far off places these days due to this cleanliness so much space is available that now all the offices are converging at one place in the past even the ministry of information and broadcasting also made a lot of effort in its offices in mumbai ahmedabad kolkata shillong in many cities and because of that today they have two three floors available completely in usage anew due to this cleanliness in itself we are getting the best experience of optimum utilizations of our resources in the society as well as in the villages cities and even in the offices even for the country this campaign is proving useful in every way my dear countrymen a new awareness is dawning in our country about our art and culture a new consciousness is awakening in mann ki baat we often discuss such examples just as art literature and culture are the collective capital of the society in the same way it is the responsibility of the whole society to take them forward one such successful effort is being made in lakshadweep there is a club on kalpeni island kummel brothers challengers club this club inspires the youth to preserve the local culture and traditional arts here the youth are trained in the local art kolkali parichakli kilipaat and traditional songs that is the old heritage is being protected in the hands of the new generation is moving forward and friends i am happy that such efforts are being made not only in the country but also abroad recently news came in from dubai that the kalari club there has registered its name in the guinness book of world records anyone could think that if dubai s club set a record what is its relation with india actually this record is related to kalaripayattu the ancient martial art of india this record is for the performance of kalari by the maximum number of people simultaneously kalari club dubai together with dubai police planned this and displayed it on the national day of uae in this event people ranging from 4 years old children to 60 years olds showed their best ability of kalari this is a wonderful example of how different generations are carrying forward an ancient tradition with full inner enthusiasm friends i would also like to inform the listeners of mann ki baat about quemashree ji who lives in gadak district of karnataka in the south quemshree has been continuously engaged for the last 25 years in the mission of reviving the art culture of karnataka you can imagine how great his tpasya is earlier he was associated with the profession of hotel management but his attachment to his culture and tradition was so deep that he made it his mission he created a platform by the name of kala chetna this platform today organizes many programs of artists from karnataka and from india and abroad in this many innovative endeavours are also undertaken to promote local art and culture friends this enthusiasm of the countrymen towards their art and culture is a manifestation of the feeling of pride in our heritage in our country there are so many such colors scattered in every corner we should also work continuously to adorn and preserve them my dear countrymen many beautiful and useful things are made from bamboo in many areas of the country there are skilled bamboo artisans skilled artists especially in tribal areas ever since the country changed the british era laws related to bamboo a huge market has developed for it even in areas like palghar in maharashtra tribal people make many beautiful products from bamboo things like boxes chairs teapots baskets and trays made of bamboo are becoming very popular not only this these people also make beautiful clothes and decorations from bamboo grass this is also providing employment to tribal women and their talent is also getting recognition friends a couple from karnataka is sending many unique products made from betelnut fiber to the international market this is a couple from shivamogga in karnataka shriman suresh and his wife shrimati maithili these people are making many decorative things ranging from trays plates and handbags from betel nut fiber chappals made of this fiber are also being liked a lot today today their products are being sold in london and other markets of europe this is the very quality of our natural resources and traditional skills which is being liked by everyone in this traditional knowledge of india the world is looking at ways of a sustainable future we ourselves also need to be more and more aware in this direction we ourselves should use such indigenous and local products and gift them to others as well this will also strengthen our identity strengthen the local economy and in large numbers brighten the future of the people my dear countrymen now we are slowly moving towards the unprecedented milestone of the 100th episode of mann ki baat i have received letters from many countrymen in which they have expressed great inquisitiveness about the 100th episode i would like it if you send me your suggestions for what we should talk about in the 100th episode and how to make it special next time we will meet in the year 2023 i wish you all the best for the year 2023 may this year also be special for the country may the country keep touching new heights and together we have to take a resolution as well as make it come true at this time many people are also in the mood for holidays enjoy these festivals a lot but be a little cautious too you are also seeing that corona is increasing in many countries of the world so we have to take more care of precautions like

25-Feb-18,"In the February 2018 edition of Mann Ki Baat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated National Science Day, emphasizing the importance of scientific discovery and the potential of artificial intelligence to enhance various aspects of life, including helping the disabled and improving healthcare.

The Prime Minister highlighted the Gobar Dhan scheme, which aims to convert organic waste into compost and biogas, contributing to cleanliness and rural development.

The Prime Minister shared the story of electrifying Elephanta Island and concluded with wishes for a joyous and colorful Holi festival.",25-feb-2018 my dear countrymen namaskar let us begin today s mann ki baat with a phone call phone call thank you very much for your phone call my young friends have asked me many questions related to science they keep writing on quite a few points all of us have seen that the sea appears blue but we know from routine life experiences that water has no colour at all have we ever thought why water acquires colour in rivers and seas the same thought occurred to a young man in the 1920s the same question gave rise to a great scientist of modern india when we talk about science the first name that strikes us is that of bharat ratna sir c v raman he was awarded the nobel prize for his outstanding work on light scattering one of his discoveries is famous as the raman effect we celebrate the 28th of february as national science day since on this very day he is said to have discovered the phenomenon of light scattering for which the nobel prize was conferred upon him this land has given birth to many a great scientist on the one hand there has been a tradition of great mathematicians like bodhayan bhaskar brahmagupt and aryabhatt on the other in the field of medicine sushrut charak have bestowed upon us a place of pride right from sir jagdish chandra bose and hargobind khurana to satyendranath bose have brought laurels to india the famous particle boson has been named after satyendranath bose recently i got an opportunity to take part in a programme in mumbai the inauguration of the wadhwani institute for artificial intelligence it was interesting to know about the ongoing miraculous accomplishments in the field of science artificial intelligence aids in making robots bots and other machines meant for specific tasks through self learning machines today can enhance their intelligence to a smarter level this technology can be harnessed to better the lives of the underprivileged the marginalized and the needy in that programme on artificial intelligence i urged the scientific community to deliberate on how artificial intelligence could help us make life easier for our divyang brothers sisters can we make better predictions of natural disasters using artificial intelligence can we use it to provide assistance to farmers on crop yield can artificial intelligence be used as tool to simplify the outreach of health services and modernize medical treatment a few days ago i got an opportunity to accompany the prime minister of israel to ahmedabad gujarat for the inauguration of i create there a young person referred to developing a digital instrument that converts the written word into voice this is to aid those who are incapable of speech to converse normally like any other person i feel we can harness artificial intelligence in many such fields science and technology are value neutral they don t possess any value in themselves any machine will work the way we want it to it entirely depends on us what task we want it to perform here human objectives assume significance the use of science for the sole purpose of human welfare with the endeavour to assist human lives touch the greatest heights thomas alva edison the inventor of the light bulb failed many a time in his experiments once on being asked about it he quipped i have devised ten thousand ways of how not to make a light bulb what i mean to say is edison transformed even his failures into his own strength coincidentally i am fortunate today to be in auroville the land the karmabhoomi of maharshi arvind as a revolutionary he challenged british rule fought against them and questioned subjugation thus as a great sage he questioned every facet of life extracting answers he showed the right path to humanity the relentless quest to ask questions for knowing the truth is very important and this is the very essence the real inspiration behind scientific inventions and discoveries never rest till every why what how are answered i congratulate our scientists and all those connected with science on the occasion of national science day may our young generation be inspired for the quest of truth knowledge may they be motivated to serve society through science i wish them the best friends safety in the times of crises disasters are topics on which many messages keep coming in people keep writing to me in a comment posted on narendra modi mobile app shriman ravindra singh from pune has referred to occupational safety he writes that in our country safety standards at factories and construction sites are not upto the mark since the 4th of march is national safety day the prime minister should include safety in the mann ki baat programme in order to raise awareness on safety when we refer to public safety two aspects are very important proactiveness and preparedness safety is of two kinds one is safety during disasters and the other is safety in everyday life if we are not aware of safety in daily life if we are not able to attain a certain level it will get extremely difficult during the time of disasters we often read signboards on streets bearing lines such as lose alertness invite mishaps or one mistake can cost you dear rob you of your joy smile or don t be in a hurry to leave this world embrace the culture of safety or don t play around with safety your life will be treated cheap beyond that these sentences serve no purpose in our lives leave aside natural disasters most of the mishaps are a consequence of some mistake or the other on our part if we stay alert abide by the prescribed rules regulations we shall not only be able to save our own lives but we can prevent catastrophes harming society there are times when we come across many slogans on safety at the work place but none following their letter and spirit i urge the fire brigade under corporations and municipalities to visit school children once a week or once a month and perform mock drills for them this will have a dual benefit the fire brigade will undergo an exercise in readiness and the new generation will get lessons in alertness and all this at no added cost in a way it will a natural part of the overall learning curve india is a land of geographic and climatic diversities as far as disasters are concerned this country has borne the brunt of many a natural as well as man made disaster such as chemical industrial mishaps today the national disaster management authority ndma is the vanguard when it comes to dealing with disasters in the country during earthquakes floods cyclones landslides ndma reaches the area within no time they have issued guidelines simultaneously they keep imparting training on a regular basis for capacity building in districts prone to floods and cyclones an initiative names aapada mitra has been launched for training volunteers training and awareness have a very important role to play two three years ago thousands of people would lose their lives every year due to heat wave after that ndma organized workshops on heat wave management as part of a campaign to raise awareness in people mass participation led to good results in 2017 the death toll on account of heat wave remarkably came down to around 220 or so this proves that if we accord priority to safety we can actually attain safety i laud the role played by innumerable individuals citizens who immediately embark upon rescue and relief operations wherever a disaster strikes and there are numerous such unnamed unsung heroes our fire rescue services national disaster response forces armed forces paramilitary forces these brave hearts go beyond the call of duty to help people in distress often risking their own lives organisations like ncc and scouts are also contributing in this task they are getting trained too recently we have made an attempt to have joint exercise for disaster management between countries on the lines of joint military exercise involving different countries of the world india has made a pioneering effort bimstec bangladesh india myanmar sri lanka thailand bhutan nepal a joint disaster management exercise involving these countries was undertaken it was a novel humanitarian experiment on a large scale we ll have to turn ourselves into a risk conscious society in our culture we often talk of safety of values we now need to realize the values of safety we ll have to make it part of our life our being in day to day life during air travel we must have frequently come across air hostesses giving out a rather longish speech safety instructions at the beginning of a flight we must have heard it hundreds of times but today if one of us is taken inside an aircraft and asked about the location of equipments say life jackets and how to use them i can say for sure that none of us will be able to give the right answer so was there a provision for giving our information yes there was was there a scope of direct visibility when the information was given of course there was but we did not respond actively why because by nature we are not conscious and that is why our ears hear when we sit in the aircraft but no one realizes that these instructions are for me we experience this in all walks of life let us not think that safety is only meant for someone else if all of us become conscious and aware of our own safety the essence of safety of society will be inbuilt my dear countrymen in the current budget emphasis has been laid on turning waste to wealth and waste to energy through bio gas under the swachch bharat campaign an effort was initiated which was named gobar dhan galvanizing organic bio agro resources the aim of this gobar dhan scheme is ensuring cleanliness in villages and generating wealth and energy by converting cattle dung and solid agricultural waste into compost and bio gas india is home to the highest cattle population in the world close to 300 million in number with a daily output of 3 million tonnes of dung some european countries and china use animal dung and other bio waste to produce energy but india was lacking full capacity utilization under the swachch bharat mission rural we are taking rapid strides in this direction a target has been set to use cattle dung agricultural waste kitchen waste to produce bio gas based energy under the gobardhan scheme our farmer brothers sisters in rural india will be encouraged to consider dung and other waste not just as a waste but as a source of income under the aegis of gobardhanyojana many benefits will accrue to rural areas it will be easier to keep the village clean and sanitized livestock health will improve and farm yields will increase biogas generation will increase self reliance in energy utilized for cooking and lighting farmers and cattle herders will be helped in augmenting their income there will be novel opportunities for newer jobs linked to waste collection transportation biogas sales etc an online trading platform will be created for better implementation of gobar dhan yojana it will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers can get the right price for dung and agricultural waste i urge entrepreneurs especially our sisters residing in rural india to step forward and through creation of self help groups and cooperative societies extract full advantage from this opportunity i invite you to become part of the movement comprising clean energy and green jobs to become a part of the initiative to convert waste in your village to wealth and by converting dung into gobar dhan my dear countrymen till date we have been hearing about the myriad types of festivals be it music festivals food festivals film festivals and many other kinds of festivals but in a unique endeavor in raipur chhattisgarh the state s first trash mahotsav was organized the objective behind this festival sponsored by raipur municipal corporation was to generate awareness about cleanliness and the methods using which city s waste can be creatively used and inculcate awareness about various ways to recycle the garbage a plethora of activities were organized during this festival which found full participation of students and adults different types of artifacts were made utilizing garbage many workshops were organized to inform people on the entire aspects of waste management music performances linked to the theme of hygiene were held and art works were created raipur inspired various types of such garbage or trash festivals in other districts too many individuals taking initiative on their own behalf shared innovative ideas held discussions conducted poetry recitals a festive atmosphere regarding cleanliness got geared up the way the school children took part in the entire endeavor was amazing for the innovative manner in which importance of waste management and cleanliness were displayed in this festival i congratulate the people of raipur municipal corporation the entire populace of chhattisgarh its government and administration every year on march 8 international women s day is celebrated there are many programs that are held in our country and the world on this day women are also felicitated with nari shakti puraskar who have performed exemplary tasks in different sectors in the past today the country is moving forward from the path of women development to women led development on this occasion i remember the words of swami vivekananda he d said the idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence this idea of swami ji about one hundred and twenty five years ago expresses the contemplation of woman power in indian culture today it is our duty to ensure the participation of women in every field of life be it social or economic life it is our fundamental duty we are part of a tradition where men were identified due to women yashoda nandan kaushalya nandan gandhari putra these were identities of a son today our woman power has shown inner fortitude and self confidence has made herself self reliant not only has she advanced herself but has carried forward the country and society to newer heights after all our dream of new india is the one where women are strong and empowered and are equal partners in the development of the country a few days ago a gentleman had given me a very sound proposition he had suggested that on 8th march myriad events herald women s day why cannot we felicitate mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every indian village or city can a program of paying respect for such centenarians be held and cannot we reflect upon a life lived long i liked the idea and i m bouncing it with you will find many examples of what woman power can achieve if you look around near yourself many such inspiring stories will appear i just received news from jharkhand wherein under the swachh bharat abhiyan about 1 5 million women in jharkhand and this figure is not a small one organized a hygiene campaign for an entire month under the auspices of this campaign starting from january 26 2018 these women constructed 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days and made a record of sorts there were about one lakh sakhi mandals 14 lakh women 2 thousand women panchayat representatives 29 thousand water carriers 10 thousand female cleaners and 50 thousand women masons were involved in this campaign you can imagine what a mammoth undertaking it was these women of jharkhand have shown that women power is an integral component of swachh bharat abhiyan which will change the course of the campaign of cleanliness in general life the effective role of hygiene in the nature of the people ingeneral my dear brothers and sisters i was just watching the tv news two days ago that electricity has reached three villages of the elephanta island after 70 years of independence and this has led to much joy and enthusiasm among the people there you all know very well that elephanta is located 10 kms by the sea from mumbai it is a very important tourist destination the caves of elephanta are marked as the world heritage sites by unesco and draw tourists from all over the country and abroad i was surprised to know that despite being such a prominent center of tourism its close proximity from mumbai electricity hadn t reached elephanta after so many years of independence for 70 years the lives of the denizens of three villages of the elephanta island rajbunder morbandar and centabandar were engulfed by darkness which has got dispelled now and there is brightness in their lives i congratulate the administration and the populace there i am glad that now the villages of elephanta and the caves of elephanta will be lighted due to electrification this is not just electricity but a new beginning of a period of development there is no greater contentment and joy than the fact that the lives of the countrymen be full of shine and there be happiness in their lives my dear brothers and sisters we just celebrated the festival of shivaratri and now the month of march beckons us with ripe crops in the fields playful golden earrings of wheat and the captivating blossom of mango pleasing to the mind are the highlights of this month but this month is also very special to all of us because of the festival of holi on 2nd march the entire country immersed in joy will celebrate the festival of holi in the festival of holi the importance of colors is as important as the ceremony of holikadahan because it is the day when we burn our inherent vices in the fire holi makes us forget our rancours and gives us an opportunity to be a part of each other s happiness and glad tidings and

olympics watching indian sportspersons march carrying the tricolour exhilarated not just me but the entire country as if the whole country unitedly exhorted her warriors saying vijayi bhava emerge victorious when these sportspersons had departed from india i had the opportunity of chatting with them knowing about them and conveying it to the country these sportspersons have reached where they are after overcoming numerous hurdles in life today they possess the strength of your love and support that s why come let us together extend our good wishes to all of them encourage them on social media our victory punch campaign for the support of olympics sportspersons has begun do share your victory punch with your team cheer for india friends it is but natural to get emotional in honour of

bravery and patience on part of india s armed forces which the whole world has watched this time this pride filled day will be celebrated amid amrit mahotsav that is why this day becomes all the more special i wish you read the enthralling saga of kargil let us all bow to the bravehearts of kargil friends this time on the 15th of august the country is entering her 75th year of independence we are indeed very fortunate that we are witnessing 75 years of freedom a freedom that the country waited for for centuries you may remember to commemorate 75 years of freedom amrit mahotsav had commenced on the 12th of march from bapu s sabarmati ashram on this very day bapu s dandi yatra too was revived since then from jammu kashmir to puduchery from gujarat to the northeast programmes in connection with amrit mahotsav are being held across the country there are many such incidents such freedom fighters whose contribution have been huge but had not been adequately discussed today people are able to know about them now take moirang day for instance the tiny town of moirang in manipur was once a major base of netaji subhash chandra bose s indian national army ina here even before independence col shaukat malik ji of ina had unfurled the flag during amrit mahotsav on the 14th of april the tricolour was once again hoisted at that very moirang innumerable such freedom fighters and great men are being remembered by the country during amrit mahotsav programmes in that connection are being successively organized by the government and social organisations a similar event is about to take place on the 15th of august this time this is an endeavour connected with the national anthem it s an effort on part of the ministry of culture to have maximum number of indians sing the national anthem together for this a website too has been created rashtragan in with the help of this website you can render the national anthem and record it thereby getting connected with the campaign i hope you connect yourselves with this novel initiative in the days to come you will get to see many such campaigns and efforts amrit mahotsav is not a programme of any government neither a programme of any political party it is a programme of crores and crores of indians a bow to our freedom fighters by every independent and grateful indian and the extension of the basic sentiment behind this festival is immense the spirit entails treading the path of our freedom fighters building a country of their dreams just the way champion proponents of freedom had joined hands for the cause we have to come together for the development of the country we have to live for the country work for the country and in that even the smallest of efforts too produce big results we can contribute to nation building even while performing our routine chores such as vocal for local supporting local entrepreneurs artists craftsmen weavers should come naturally to us the national handloom day on the 7th of august is an occasion when we can strive to attempt that national handloom day has a remarkable historic background on this very day in 1905 the swadeshi andolan had begun friends in the rural and tribal regions of our country handloom is a major source of income this is a sector that comprises lakhs of women weavers and craftsmen even small efforts on your part will give rise to a new hope in weavers do purchase something or the other and share your thought with others as well now that we are celebrating 75 years of independence it of course becomes our responsibility you must have noticed that year 2014 onwards we often touch upon khadi in mann ki baat it is only on account of your efforts that today the sale of khadi has risen manifold could anyone even think that in any khadi store the sales figure would cross one crore rupees but you have made that possible too whenever wherever you purchase a khadi product it does benefit our poor weaver brothers and sisters that is why in a way buying khadi is service to people service to the country i urge you my dear brothers and sisters to make it a point to definitely buy handloom products being made in rural areas and share it on myhandloommypride friends when one refers to the freedom movement and khadi remembering revered bapu is but natural just the way the quit india movement bharat chhoro andolan steered under bapu s leadership every countryman today has to lead a bharat jodo andolan it is our duty to ensure that our work helps closely knit bind our india which is filled with diversity come on amrit mahotsav let us make a sacred amrit resolve that the country remains to be our highest faith our topmost priority we have to move forward with the mantra nation first always first my dear countrymen today i wish to express my special thanks to my young friends tuned in to mann ki baat just a few days ago on part of mygov a study was conducted regarding the listeners of mann ki baat in this study primarily people who send messages and suggestions were focused upon the study revealed the fact that out of those sending messages and suggestions close to 75 are below the age of 35 meaning thereby that the suggestions of the youth power of india are steering mann ki baat i view this as a very good indicator mann ki baat is a medium which has positivity sensitivity in mann ki baat we talk about positive things its character is collective this activism for positive thoughts and suggestions in the youth delights me i am happy also about the opportunity that i get through mann ki baat to know of the minds of the youth friends suggestions received from you are the real strength of mann ki baat it is your suggestions through mann ki baat that express the diversity of india spread the fragrance of service and sacrifice of indians in all the four directions inspire one and all through the innovation of our toiling youth you send ideas of various kinds in mann ki baat we are not able to discuss all of them but i do send many of them to related departments so that further work can be done on them friends i want to tell you about the efforts of saayee praneeth ji saayee praneeth ji is a software engineer hailing from andhra paradesh last year he saw that in his area farmers had to suffer a lot due to the vagaries of weather for years he had interest in meteorology so he decided to use his interest and talent for the welfare of farmers now he purchases weather data from different data sources analyses them and sends necessary information through various media to farmers in local language besides weather updates praneeth ji also gives guidance to people about what they should do in different climatic conditions especially how to be safe from floods or how to avoid storm or lightning he talks about this too friends on the one hand this effort of a young software engineer touches our hearts on the other the use of technology by one of our friends will amaze us this friend shriman isaak munda ji hails from a village in sambalpur district of odisha isaak ji once used to work as a daily wager but now he has become an internet sensation he is earning a lot through his youtube channel in his videos he shows prominently the local dishes traditional ways of cooking his village his lifestyle family and food habits his journey as a youtuber began in march 2020 when he posted a video related to pakhal the famous local dish of odisha since then he has posted hundreds of videos this effort of his is different for many reasons specially because through this people living in cities get a chance to watch the lifestyle about which they don t know much isaak munda ji is celebrating by blending culture and cuisine equally and inspiring us too friends while we are discussing technology i want to discuss of an interesting subject recently you must have read seen that a start up established by an alumni of iit madras has made a 3d printed house the construction of the house through 3d printing how did this happen after all actually this start up first of all fed a 3 dimensional design in a 3 d printer and then through a concrete of a special kind fabricated a 3 d structure layer by layer you will be happy to know that many experiments of this kind are being done throughout the country there was a time when it would take years to complete even a minor construction but today due to technology the situation is changing in india some time ago we had launched a global housing technology challenge to invite such innovative companies from all over the world this is a unique attempt of its kind in the country hence we gave it the name light house projects for now work on light house projects is on at a fast pace at 6 different locations in the country modern technology and innovative methods are used in these light house projects this reduces the duration of construction along with that the houses that are constructed are more durable economical and comfortable recently through drones i also reviewed these projects and saw live their work progress in the project at indore pre fabricated sandwich panel system is being used in place of brick and mortar walls in rajkot the light house is being made with french technology in which through a tunnel monolithic concrete construction technology is being used houses made with this technology will be lot more capable of withstanding disasters in chennai the pre cast concrete system technologies form america and finland are being used by this houses will get built faster and the cost too will be low in ranchi houses will be built using the 3d construction system of germany in this every room will be constructed separately and then the entire structure will be joined together the way block toys are joined in agartala using technology from new zealand houses that can withstand major earthquakes are being made with steel frame meanwhile in lucknow technology from canada is being used in this plaster and paint will not be required and walls prepared in advance will be used to build houses faster friends today an attempt is being made in the country to ensure that these projects work as incubation centers through this our planners architects engineers and students will know of new technology and experiment with them too i am sharing these things especially with our youth so that in the interest of the nation they are encouraged towards technology in newer fields my dear countrymen you must have heard of an english adage to learn is to grow that is to learn is to progress when we learn something new doors to new advances open up automatically for us whenever effort to do something new different from the rut has been made new doors have opened for humankind a new era has begun and you must have seen whenever something new happens anywhere its result surprises everyone now for example if i ask you which the states that you would connect with apples are obviously in your mind first of all the name of himachal pradesh jammu kashmir and uttarakhand would strike but if i ask you to add the name of manipur too to this list you will probably be filled with surprise youths filled with passion to do something new have demonstrated this feat in manipur nowadays apple farming is picking up fast in the ukhrul district of manipur farmers here are growing apples in their orchards to learn apple farming these people have taken formal training by going to himachal one of these is t s ringphami young by profession he is an aeronautical engineer he along with his wife shrimati t s angel has grown apples similarly avungshee shimre augasteena too has grown apples in her orchard avungshee had a job in delhi she returned to her village quitting this and started farming apple there are many such apple growers in manipur who have demonstrated something different and something new friends in our tribal communities ber fruit has always been very popular the members of the tribal community have always been cultivating ber but its cultivation is increasing especially after the covid 19 pandemic bikramjit chakma of 32 years of age is my young friend from unakoti tripura he has not only earned a lot of profit by starting the ber cultivation now he is also motivating people to do ber cultivation the state government has also come forward to help such people many special nurseries have been started by the government for this purpose so that the demand of the people associated with the cultivation of ber can be met innovation is happening in agriculture so creativity is also being witnessed in the by products of agriculture friends i have also come to know about an attempt made in lakhimpurkheri in uttar pradesh a unique initiative has taken place in lakhimpurkheri during the period of covid itself here the work of training women to manufacture fibre from the waste banana stems was started the way to make the best out of the waste banana fibre is prepared by cutting the stem of a banana with the help of a machine the fibre is like jute or flax handbags mats rugs many things are made from this fibre through this the utilization of crop waste started on the other hand our sisters and daughters living in the village acquired another source of income through this work of banana fibre a woman from the area earns four to six hundred rupees per day banana is cultivated on hundreds of acres of land in lakhimpur kheri after the harvesting of banana the farmers usually had to spend a separate sum to dispose of its stem now not only their money is being saved and lending credence to the saying of getting two of something for the price of one friends on the one hand products are being manufactured from banana fibre on the other delicious dishes like dosa and gulabjamun are also being made from banana flour women in uttara kannada and dakshina kannada districts of karnataka are doing this unique work this endeavour also began in the corona period itself these women not only prepared things like dosa gulabjamun from banana flour they also shared their pictures on social media when more people came to know about the banana flour its demand also increased and so did the income of these women like lakhimpur kheri here too women are leading this innovative idea friends such examples become the inspiration to do something new in life there must be many such people around you too when your family is involved in close conversations you should also make these a part of your chat take out some time and go to see such efforts with children and if you get the opportunity do something like this yourself and yes i would like it if you share all this with me on namo app or mygov my dear countrymen there is a verse in our sanskrit texts atmantharmjeevalokeasmin ko na jeevtimanavah paramparopkarathram yojeevatisajeevati that is everyone in this world lives for himself but in actuality only the person who exists for the sake of others really lives talking about the philanthropic efforts of the sons and daughters of mother india is what mann ki baat is all about today also we ll talk about some of these friends one of our friends hails from chandigarh city i too have lived in chandigarh for a few years it is a very cheerful and beautiful city the people of chandigarh are also large hearted and yes if you are a foodie you will have more fun here in sector 29 of chandigarh sanjay rana ji runs a food stall and sells chole bhature on his cycle one day his daughter riddhima and niece riya came to him with an idea both requested him to feed chole bhature for free to those who had got the covid vaccine he happily agreed to the suggestion and immediately started this good and noble effort to eat sanjay rana ji schole bhature for free you have to show that you have got the vaccine administered on the very day as soon as you show the vaccination message he will give you delicious chole bhature it is said that for the welfare of the society spirit of service and duty are required more than money our sanjay bhai is proving this saying to be right friends i would like to discuss another such work today this effort is being attempted in nilgiri of tamil nadu here radhika shastriji has started the amburx amburex project the purpose of this project is to provide easy transport for the treatment of patients in hilly areas radhika runs a cafe in coonoor she raised funds for amburx from her cafe colleagues today six amburx are serving in the nilgiri hills and are coming to the aid of patients in remote parts during the time of emergency an amburx is equipped with a stretcher oxygen cylinder first aid box and other things friends whether it is sanjay ji or radhika ji their examples demonstrate that we can render service while doing our routine work our business or job friends a few days back a very interesting and very emotional event occurred which imparted new strength to india georgia friendship in this ceremony india handed over the holy relic or icon of saint queen ketevan to the government of georgia and the people there for this mission our foreign minister himself went there the ceremony which took place in a very emotionally charged atmosphere was attended by the president of georgia the prime minister many religious leaders and a large number of georgians the words that were said in praise of india in this ceremony are indeed very memorable this single ceremony has not only strengthened the relations between the two nations but as well as between goa and georgia this is because these holy relics of saint queen ketevan were found in 2005 from saint augustine church in goa friends the question arising in your mind must be what is this matter all about and when and how did this happen actually this is an incident about four to five hundred years ago queen ketevan was the daughter of the royal family of georgia in 1624 after ten years of imprisonment she was martyred according to an ancient portuguese document the mortal remains of saint queen ketevan were kept in the saint augustine convent of old goa but for a long time it was believed that her remains buried in goa were lost in the earthquake of 1930 after decades of tireless efforts by the indian government and georgia s historians researchers archaeologists and the georgian church the relics were successfully discovered in 2005 this is an extremely emotional topic for the people of georgia that is why keeping in mind their historical religious and spiritual sentiments the government of india decided to gift a part of these relics to the people of georgia today i would like to thank the people of goa for preserving this unique side of the shared history of india and georgia goa has been the land of many a great spiritual heritage saint augustine church is a unesco s world heritage site a part of the churches and convents of goa my dear countrymen let me now take you straight from georgia to singapore where another glorious opportunity arose earlier this month the prime minister of singapore and my friend lee hsien loong inaugurated the recently renovated silat road gurudwara he also wore the traditional sikh turban this gurudwara was built about a hundred years ago and there is also a memorial dedicated to bhai maharaj singh bhai maharaj singh ji fought for the independence of india and this moment becomes more inspiring when we are celebrating 75 years of independence the people to people strength between two countries gets a boost with such initiatives and efforts these also show how important it is to live in a harmonious environment and understand each other s culture my dear countrymen today in mann ki baat we have discussed many topics there is another subject which is very close to my heart it is the topic of water conservation the place where i spent my childhood there was always shortage of water we used to yearn for rain and thus saving every drop of water has been a part of our traditions our sanskar now this mantra of water conservation through public participation has changed the picture there saving every drop of water preventing any kind of wastage of water it should become a natural part of our lifestyle such a tradition should be made in our families which would make every member proud friends the protection of nature and environment is embedded in the cultural life of india in our daily lives at the same time rains and the monsoon have always shaped our thoughts our philosophy and our civilization in ritusanhar and meghdoot the great poet kalidas has beautifully described the rains these poems are still very popular among literature lovers the magnificence of rains is also beautifully described in the parjanya suktam of rigveda similarly the relationship between the earth the sun and the rain has been elaborated in a poetic form in the srimad bhagavata that is the sun has exploited the earth s wealth in the form of water for eight months now in the monsoon season the sun is returning this accumulated wealth to the earth indeed the monsoon and rainy season is not only beautiful and pleasant but it is also nurturing life giving the rain water that we are getting is for our future generations we should never forget that today a thought came to my mind that why not end my talk with such interesting references my very best wishes to all of you for the forthcoming festivals at the time of festivals and celebrations you must remember that corona has not yet gone from amongst us you must not forget the protocols related to corona may all of you be healthy and happy many many thanks tune in to mannkibaat july 2021 nation first always first mannkibaat happy

Finally, he encouraged youth to pursue careers in sports and expressed his support for promoting sports alongside education.",25-jun-2017 my dear countrymen namaskar the weather is changing it has been extremely hot this year but it is good that the monsoon is moving ahead on schedule on its natural course the weather has become pleasant in several parts of the country with abundant showers as a result of the rains the cool breeze has brought about some respite from the oppressive heat of past few days one has seen that no matter how hectic the life is no matter how tense we are whether its one s personal or public life the arrival of the rains does lift one s spirits the car festival of lord jagannath the rath yatra is being celebrated in several parts of the country with great piety and fervour this festival is now also celebrated in some parts of the world the underprivileged of the country are deeply connected to lord jagannath those who have studied the life and works of dr baba saheb ambedkar would have observed that he had wholeheartedly praised the lord jagannath temple and its traditions since social justice and social equality were inherent to these lord jagannath is the god of the poor but few would know that in english there is a word juggernaut which means a magnificent chariot that is unstoppable in the dictionary the etymology of the word juggernaut traces its roots to the chariot of lord jagannath and therefore we can observe that the world has in its own way accepted the significance of the car festival of lord jagannath the rath yatra on the occasion of lord jagannath s car festival i extend my heartiest greetings to all my fellow countrymen and offer my obeisance to lord jagannath india s diversity is its unique characteristic and india s diversity is also its strength the holy month of ramzan is observed all across in prayer with piety and now the festival of eid is here on the occasion of eid ul fitr my heartiest greetings to one and all ramzan is a month of charity and sharing joy the more you share joy the more it multiplies let us come together and take inspiration from these holy festivals and share their joyous treasures and take the nation forward in this holy month of ramzan i came across a very inspiring incident at mubarakpur village of bijnor in uttar pradesh about three and a half thousand families of our muslim brethren reside in that little village and in a way form a majority of its population during this ramzan the villagers decided to get together and construct toilets now to construct these household toilets the government gives financial assistance under which they were provided a sum of 17 lakh rupees you will be pleasantly surprised and happy to know that during this holy month of ramzan these muslim brothers and sisters returned this money to the government saying they would construct these toilets with their own labour and their own money and that this sum of 17 lakh rupees be used for providing other facilities in the village i felicitate the residents of mubarakpur for transforming the pious occasion of ramzan into an opportunity for the welfare of society on each and everything about them is inspiring and the most important of it all is that they have freed mubarakpur of the scourge of open defecation we know that in our country there are three states that have already been declared open defecation free states that is sikkim himachal pradesh and kerala uttarakhand and haryana have also been declared odf this week i express my gratitude to the administration government and especially the people of these five states for achieving this objective we know very well that tremendous hard work is required to achieve anything worthwhile whether it is in one s own life or for the society if we have bad handwriting and we want to improve it we have to consciously practice for a long time only then will the habit of the body and mind will change cleanliness is also similar to this these bad habits have become a part of our nature we have become accustomed to them to free ourselves of these habits we will have to constantly strive and persevere everyone s attention will have to be drawn we will have to repeatedly remind ourselves of good inspirational incidents and i m happy to see that cleanliness is no longer confined to being a government programme it is getting transformed into a movement by the society and the people and when government functionaries take this initiative forward with the participation of the masses it becomes even stronger recently i came across a wonderful incident which i would like to share with you this happened in the vizianagaram district of andhra pradesh the district administration there undertook a huge task with people s participation from 6 a m on the 10th of march till 10 am of the 14th of march a hundred hour non stop campaign and what was the objective to construct 10 000 household toilets in 71 gram panchayats in those hundred hours and my dear countrymen you will be happy to learn that the administration and the people together did construct 10 000 toilets in hundred hours successfully 71 villages became odf i congratulate the people in the government government officials and the citizens of vizianagaram district on this great accomplishment of achieving this feat through immense hard work and setting a very inspiring example in the process these days people have been regularly sending their suggestions for mann ki baat on the narendramodiapp on mygov in through letters and akashvani shri prakash tripathi reminiscing about the emergency has written presenting 25thof june as a dark period in the history of democracy prakash tripathi ji s commitment to democracy is praiseworthy not only is democracy a system but also a sanskar a part of our ethos eternal vigilance is the price of liberty one needs to be constantly alert about our democracy that is why we must also keep remembering the events that inflicted harm upon our democracy and at the same time move ahead carrying forward the virtues of democracy 1975 25th june it was a dark night that no devotee of democracy can ever forget no indian can ever forget the country had virtually become a prison the voice of the opposition had been smothered several prominent leaders including jai prakash narayan had been jailed the judicial system too could not escape the sinister shadows of the emergency the press was completely muffled the present day students of journalism and the champions of democracy have been endeavouring towards raising awareness about that dark period by constant reminders and should continue to do so atal bihari vajpayee ji was also in jail at that time after one year of emergency atal ji wrote a poem in which he describes the state of mind during those turbulent times the scorching summer month the sad winter moonlight the sobbing monsoon an emptiness pervading within an entire year has gone by the world confined behind bars but the soul like a restless bird the freedom song resonates from the earth to the sky an entire year has gone by the eyes are in anticipation counting days and moments the beloved who went away shall return one day an entire year has gone by the believers of democracy fought a prolonged war and the great nation that india is where the spirit of democracy pervades the very being of all its people the strength of that spirit was demonstrated when the opportunity of elections came we have to further fortify that legacy my dear countrymen every indian today is proud and holds his head high 21st june 2017 yoga has permeated the entire world from the seashores to the mountains people welcomed the first rays of the sun with yoga which indian wouldn t be proud of this it isn t as if yoga didn t exist before but now the threads of yoga have bound everyone together and have become the means to unite the world almost all the countries in the world made yoga day their own in china yoga was practiced on the great wall of china and on the world heritage site of machu picchu in peru at 2400 metres above sea level in france yoga was performed in the vicinity of the eiffel tower in abu dhabi in uae more than 4000 persons participated in mass yoga in herat in afghanistan on the india afghan friendship dam salma dam yoga added a new aspect to india s friendship in a small country like singapore programs were organised in 70 places with a week long campaign on the occasion of international day of yoga the un released ten stamps a yoga session with yoga masters was organised at the un headquarters the staff of the un and diplomats from across the world participated yoga has created a world record again this time also in ahmedabad in gujarat around 55 thousand people performed yoga together and created a new world record i too had the opportunity to participate in the yoga event held in lucknow but i also had the good fortune to practice yoga in the rain for the first time our soldiers practiced yoga in siachen where temperatures reach minus 20 25 40 degrees whether it is our armed forces or the bsf itbp crpf and cisf each one of them apart from their duties has made yoga a part of their lives on this yoga day since this was the third international day of yoga i had asked you to share photos of three generations of the family doing yoga together some tv channels also took this idea forward i received a lot of photographs out of which selected photographs are compiled and uploaded on the narendramodiapp one significant outcome of the way the yoga is being talked about all around the world is the portent that today s health conscious society is now taking steps from fitness to wellness and they have realised that fitness is of course important but for true wellness yoga is the best way sound bite respected prime minister sir i am dr anil sonara speaking from ahmedabad gujarat sir i have a question recently in kerala we heard you speak about replacing bouquets that we give as gifts with good books as mementos you had started this practice while you were in office in gujarat sir but in the recent days we have not been seeing much of this so can we do something about it is there nothing we can do to have this implemented throughout the country sir recently i had the opportunity to go to one of my favorite events a very good programme is being run in kerala for the past few years by the p n panicker foundation which encourages people to cultivate the habit of reading books and to enhance their awareness towards this by organising celebrations such as reading day and reading month i had the opportunity to go for the inaugural function where i was told that instead of bouquets they gift books i liked it thus i was also reminded of what had slipped my mind because when i was in gujarat i had set this tradition of welcoming by not giving bouquets but books or handkerchiefs instead and that too a khadi handkerchief so that it promotes khadi till the time i was in gujarat this habit had been ingrained in us but after coming here i had lost that habit when i went to kerala it was rekindled i have already begun to issue instructions in the government here too we can gradually nurture this habit and the life span of a bouquet is very short you receive it in your hand for a moment and then abandon it but when you present a book it becomes a part of the household a part of the family one can also use a khadi handkerchief to welcome people and be a support to the innumerable underprivileged the expenses are reduced as well and the gift is well utilized too i say this thinking of the historical value of such gifts during my past uk visit in london the queen of britain queen elizabeth had invited me to dine with her the atmosphere was imbued with maternal warmth and i was served with great affection afterwards when she showed me a small thread spun khadi handkerchief her eyes lit up with great respect and in an emotion filled voice she said that mahatma gandhi had sent this handkerchief to her as a wedding gift so many years have passed and yet queen elizabeth has treasured the handkerchief gifted by mahatma gandhi and she was happy to show it to me when i went there as i gazed at it the queen encouraged me to touch it a small gift by mahatma gandhi has become a part of her life and a part of history i know that these habits do not change overnight and when we talk about it we invite criticism despite that one should keep talking about it and keep making the effort now i cannot say that if i go somewhere and somebody brings a bouquet i will refuse it no i won t do that but we will talk about it even though there is criticism and then gradually the change will happen my dear countrymen as prime minister there are numerous tasks to be handled i have to remain deeply absorbed in files but for my own self i have developed a habit of reading daily at least a few of the letters i receive and because of that i get a chance to connect with the common man i get a variety of letters written by all sorts of people recently i had the opportunity to read a letter which i feel i should share with you from the far south in madurai tamil nadu arulmozhi sarvanan a housewife sent me a letter and what was in that letter she wrote that she thought about engaging in some economic activity keeping in mind her responsibilities such as children s education to lend some financial assistance to her family she got some money from the bank under the mudra scheme and commenced working towards procuring some items from the market for sale then she came to know of the government e marketplace system initiated by the government she tried to find out the details and asked people about it and then she registered herself for the scheme here i want to tell my countrymen that if you get the opportunity you should also visit the e g e m e gem website on the internet this is a great new system whoever wants to supply any item to the government small things such as electric bulbs dustbins brooms chairs and tables they can register themselves they can mention the quality of the goods the rate at which they sell and it is compulsory for the government departments to visit the site and see whether the supplier can supply the goods at reasonable prices without compromising on the quality and then the orders can be placed that is how the middlemen can be removed from the system the entire process becomes transparent there is no interface everything is done through technology so when people register in e gem all the government departments become aware of them as there are no middlemen the goods are available at very reasonable rates now whatever goods arulmozhi madam could supply she got all those registered on this government website and the best part is what she has written in this letter is very interesting she has written that she got the money from the mudra scheme and started her business then she registered the inventory of all her products on the e gem website and then she got an order from the prime minister s office it was news to me also i wondered what the pmo would have ordered she wrote that the pmo had ordered two thermoses and she was paid rupees 1600 this is empowerment this is an opportunity for encouraging entrepreneurship had arulmozhi not written to me i wouldn t have realised that because of e gem a housewife living far away and running a small business can have the items on her inventory purchased directly by the prime minister s office this is the nation s strength this has transparency this has empowerment this has entrepreneurship too government e marketplace gem i would certainly like that whoever wishes to sell their products or business items to the government should increasingly get connected with this website i believe that this is an excellent example of minimum government and maximum governance and it s objective is minimum price and maximum ease efficiency and transparency my dear countrymen on the one hand we take pride in yoga on the other we can also take pride in our achievements in space science and this is the unique attribute of india that whereas we have our feet firmly on the ground with yoga we have our dreams to soar beyond horizons to far away skies recently india has had many achievements in sports as well as science today india s flag is flying high not only on earth but also in space just two days ago isro launched 30 nano satellites with the cartosat 2 series satellite and besides india these satellites are of france germany italy japan britain and america nearly 14 such countries and with india s nano satellite mission we will get a lot of help in the field of agriculture farming and dealing with natural disasters we are all aware that a few days ago isro has successfully launched the gsat 19 and of all the satellites launched by india this was the heaviest satellite the newspapers of our country have compared it with elephantine weights you can well imagine the magnitude of the achievement of our scientists in space on the 19th of june our mars mission completed one thousand days you may be aware that when we had successfully created a place for the mars mission in orbit this entire mission was planned for a duration of 6 months it had a life expectancy of 6 months but i m happy that the strength of the endeavours of our scientists has been such that not only has this crossed six months even after a thousand days our mangalyaan mission is at work sending images providing information collating scientific data way beyond its expected duration and life expectancy the completion of one thousand days is an important milestone in our scientific journey our space odyssey these days we see that our youth are getting increasingly inclined to the field of sports it is becoming evident that along with studies our new generations can see a future in sports as well and our sportspersons through their prowess skills and accomplishments win laurels for the country as well recently india s badminton player kidambi shrikant has brought glory to the nation by winning indonesia open i extend my heartiest congratulations to him and his coach for this victory i had the opportunity a few days ago to be associated with the inaugural function of the synthetic track of the renowned athlete p t usha s usha school of athletics the more we promote sports the more we see the spirit of sportsmanship sports play an important role in personality development also there is a great significance of sports in overall personality development there is no dearth of talent in our country if the children in our family are interested in sports they should be given opportunities they should not be forced off the playing fields to be locked in rooms with books they should study as well if they can do well in studies they should certainly do so but if they have the potential and the inclination to do well in sports that should be encouraged and supported by the school college family and all the people around them each one should nurture dreams for the next olympics my dear countrymen let me mention once again that this season of rains with its abundance of festivals and festivities brings with it a unique new feeling of the times i extend my heartiest greetings to you all until the next episode of mann ki baat when i shall share my thoughts with you once again

naam the chant of lord ram s name permeated every moment of revered bapu s life a while ago when distinguished dignitaries of all asean countries were here on the 26th of january they were accompanied by cultural troupes from their respective countries and it s a matter of immense pride that a majority of these countries presented the ramayan in front of us this signifies that ram ramayan continues to inspire and have a positive impact not just in india but in that part of the world too once again my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of ramnavami my dear countrymen just like every time earlier i have received a rather large number of letters e mails phone calls and comments from you i read a post written on mygov by komal thakkar ji where she has referred to starting on line courses

are from children who have written about exams they have shared their vacation plans they ve expressed their concern on the availability of water for birds animals our farmer brothers sisters have written on kisan melas farmer carnivals and activities revolving around farming being held across the country quite a few active citizens have sent in suggestions on the subject of water conservation ever since we have begun conversing with each other in mann ki baat through the medium of radio i have noticed a pattern that in the sweltering heat of this season most letters focus around topic pertaining to summer time just before examinations letter pour in touching on the anxieties of our young student friends who are about to appear during the festival season our festivals our culture our traditions are focused upon this means mann ki batein matters close to our hearts alter with the change in season and it s equally true that our heartfelt thoughts do bring about a change of season in someone s life figuratively speaking and why should not things change in utterances of yours in your experiences in the examples that you quote there exists immense inspiration unfathomable energy unparalleled warmth a resolve to bring about something new for the country in a way this is endowed with the might to transform the entire season cycle of the country when i get to read in your letters how a rickshaw puller from karimgunj in assam ahmed ali has built nine schools for underprivileged children i witness firsthand the indomitable will power this country possesses when i heard the story of kanpur based dr ajit mohan choudhary of how he visits the underprivileged on footpaths and offers free medicines to them it gives one an opportunity to feel the sense of brotherhood that prevails in the country thirteen years ago on account of a delay in medical treatment a cab driver from kolkata saidul laskar lost his sister he vowed to construct a hospital in order to ensure that none of the underprivileged face a similar situation due to lack of medical aid in this mission of his saidul sold off family jewellery and raised funds through charity his cab passengers too contributed large heartedly a young engineer girl donated her first salary for this noble cause this way after mobilizing funds for twelve long years saidul s mammoth efforts paid rich dividends today through sheer hard work and a firm resolve a thirty bedded hospital has finally come up at punri village near kolkata this is the power of new india in uttar pradesh when a woman builds 125 toilets after overcoming steep challenges inspiring women to exercise their due rights it gives us a glimpse of matri shakti the power of maternal love caring innumerable shining examples like these are the hallmark of our country today the whole world has changed the way it looks at india the name india now evokes a sense of awe respect the reason behind it is the purusharth the resolute yet selfless inner strength of such illustrious sons daughters of mother india today the entire country the youth women the marginalized the underprivileged the middle class in fact every section has awakened to a new confidence yes we can go forward the country can take great strides an atmosphere of positivity built on a self confidence filled with hope has pervaded all over this self confidence this very positivity will by a catalyst in realising our resolve of new india of making our dream come true my dear countrymen the coming months are very crucial for our farming brothers and sisters that is why a large number of letters on agriculture have been received this time i requisitioned and viewed videos of discussions with our farmers on dd kisan channel of doordarshan and i feel that each farmer should get connected to this dd kisan channel of doordarshan view it and adopt those practices in his her own farm from mahatma gandhi to shastri ji lohia ji chaudhari charan singh ji chaudhari devi lal ji they all recognized agriculture and the farmer as vital aspects of the nation s economy and also for the common man s life how attached was mahatma gandhi attached to the soil they farms and the farmer is reflected from this sentence in which he said to forget how to dig earth and to tend the soil is to forget ourselves similarly lal bahadur shastriji generally insisted on conservation of trees plants and vegetation and also highlighted the importance of an improvised agricultural infrastructure dr ram manohar lal ji had talked of creating a mass awakening on an extensive scale about the necessary measures to ensure a better income for our farmers and provide better irrigation facilities and to increase food and milk production chaudhari charan singh in his speech in 1979 had urged our farmers to use new technology and to adopt new innovations and underlined their vital significance i recently visited the krishi unnati mela organized in new delhi it was a pleasant experience for me to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters and scientists and to listen and understand their experiences in farming and getting to know about innovations in the agricultural sector but one thing that impressed me most was meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers of the state this state has a small area but it has attained a grand success our farmers in meghalaya in the year 2015 16 achieved record production as compared to the last five years they have showed that if once the targets are set spirits are high and with a strong resolve the set targets can most certainly be attained today the farmers have technology to help them while they work hard in their fields this has provided a big boost to our agro producers i have received a number of letters in which a large number of farmers have written about msp and they wanted that i should talk to them at length over this brothers and sisters in this year s budget a big decision has been taken to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce it has been decided that the msp of notified crops will be fixed at least one and a half times of their cost if i may elaborate on this msp will include labour cost of other workers employed expenses incurred on own animals and cost of animals and machinery taken on rent cost of seeds cost of each type of fertilizer used irrigation cost land revenue paid to the state government interest paid on working capital ground rent in case of leased land and not only this but also the cost of labour of the farmer himself or any other person of his family who contributes his or her labour in agricultural work will also be added to the cost of production moreover an extensive exercise on agricultural reforms is being undertaken across the country in order to ensure that our farmers get a fair price for their crop efforts are on to connect local village mandis to wholesale market and then on with the global market twenty two thousand rural haats in the country will be upgraded by creating the necessary infrastructure and these will be integrated with apmc and e nam platform so that the farmers would not have to go to distant places for selling their produce in other words such a system is being set up where in farms in any part of the country will have a market connect my dear countrymen this year mahatma gandhi s 150th birth anniversary celebrations will begin how should the country celebrate it swachch bharat is already our resolve besides this how can our 125 crore countrymen pay the best tribute to gandhiji by working in close harmony which newer programmes can be initiated what new practices or procedures can be adopted i request you all to share your opinions and suggestions with everyone via mygov what should be the logo for gandhi 150 what should be the slogan mantra or a catch phrase send your suggestions on all of these we all have to pay a memorable tribute to bapu and have to take the country to newer heights by drawing inspiration from bapu thanks you have rightly said it and i believe that swachch bharat and swasth bharat are supplementary to each other in the health sector the nation has now moved ahead from the conventional approach earlier every aspect regarding health used to be a responsibility of the health ministry alone but now all departments and ministries be it the sanitation ministry or ayush ministry or ministry of chemicals fertilizers consumer affairs ministry or the women child welfare ministry or even the state governments they are all working together for swasth bharat and stress is being laid on affordable health alongside preventive health preventive health care is the least costly and the easiest one as well and the more we become aware about preventive health care the more beneficial will it be for the individuals the family and the society the first necessity for a healthy life is cleanliness all of us took up the responsibility and the result is that in the last four years or so sanitation coverage has almost doubled and risen to around 80 percent also extensive work is going on to set up health wellness centres across the country yoga has attained worldwide recognition as a measure of preventive health care yoga is a guarantee of both fitness and wellness it is the result of our concerted efforts and commitment that yoga has now become a mass movement and reached every house less than a hundred days are now left for the international yoga day on 21st june on the previous three international yoga days people in our country and people all over the world participated with great zeal and enthusiasm this time too we need to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and motivate our family friends and all others from now itself to do yoga yoga has to be made popular among the youth the senior citizens men and women from all age groups through interesting ways usually the country s television and electronic media do a variety of programmes on yoga the whole year can we beginning now till the yoga day devise a campaign to spread awareness on yoga my dear countrymen i am not a yoga teacher but yes i surely am a yoga practitioner and yet some people through their creativity have made me a yoga teacher as well and 3 d animated videos of my yoga practice sessions have been prepared i will share these videos with you so that we may do aasans and pranayam together efforts are being extensively undertaken to make health care accessible and affordable make it easily accessible and affordable for the common man presently more than three thousand jan aushadhi kendras have been opened across the country and more than eight hundred medicines are being made available there at an affordable price more such centres are being opened i appeal to the listeners of mann ki baat to provide this information about jan anshadhi kendras to the needy ones it will cut their expense on medicines this will be a big help to them the cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85 knee implants cost has also been regulated and reduced by 50 to 70 under ayushman bharat yojana the government of india and insurance companies will jointly provide 5 lakh repees for treatment to about 10 crore families or say 50 crore citizens per year in the present 479 medical colleges mbbs seats have been increased to about 68 thousand new aiims are being opened in various states with a view to providing better treatment and health facilities to people across the country one new medical college will be set up for every three districts a target has been fixed to make the country tb free by 2025 this is an enormous task your cooperation is needed to create public awareness all of us will need to make united efforts to become tb free my dear countrymen april 14 is the birth anniversary of dr baba saheb ambedkar years ago dr baba saheb ambedkar spoke of india s industrialization according to him the industry was an effective medium by which jobs could be made available to the poorest of the poor and the poorer today the campaign of make in india is progressing successfully in consonance with dr ambedkarji s dream of india as an industrial super power that vision of his has become our inspiration today today india has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the highest foreign direct investment or fdi in the world is flowing to india the whole world is looking at india as a hub for investment innovation and development that the development of industries could only be possible in the cities was the kernel of the idea of dr baba sahib ambedkar and that was the reason he banked upon urbanization of india in continuance with his vision smart city mission and urban missionwere kick started in the country so that all kinds of amenities whether good roads water supply health facilities education or digital connectivity are available in the big cities and small towns of the country baba saheb had strong faith in self reliance he did not want anybody to languish in poverty forever he also believed that poverty cannot be ameliorated by mere distribution of capital among the impoverished today our monetary policy start up india stand up india initiative have become seedbed for our young innovators and young entrepreneurs in the 30s and 40s when only roads and railways were being talked about in india baba saheb ambedkar mentioned about ports and waterways it was dr baba saheb who envisaged water power as nation power he stressed the utilization of water for the development of the nation the genesis of different river valley authorities different water related commissions all these were possible due to the vision of baba saheb ambedkar today there are landmark efforts being embarked upon for waterways and ports in our country new seaports are being constructed on a number of seaways of india and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports in the era of 40s while most of the discussions were centred around the second world war the looming cold war and the partition it was during those times dr ambedkar had laid the foundation of team india s spirit in a way he had talked about the importance of federalism federal system and stressed on center and states working together for the upliftment of the country today we have adopted in all aspects of governance the mantra of co operative federalism and going a step further we have adopted competitive cooperative federalism but most importantly dr baba saheb ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me who belong to backward classes he showed us that to succeed it is not necessary for the person to be born in an illustrious or rich family but even those who are born to poor families in india can also dare to dream their dreams and realize those dreams by achieving success and of course this is exactly what happened as many people mocked dr baba saheb ambedkar tried to pull him back and made every possible effort to ensure that the son of an impoverished and backward family would not progress in life be something and succeed in life but the picture of new india is altogether different it is an india which is ambedkar s india of the poor and the backward on the occasion of the birth anniversary of dr ambedkar from april 14 to may 5 gram swaraj abhiyan is

25-Nov-18,"In the 50th episode of ""Mann Ki Baat"" on November 25, 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the significance of the radio program in connecting with the people of India. He shared that he turned to radio as a medium due to its unmatched reach and depth of communication, recalling a moment in 1998 when he saw the power of radio in a remote village. The program has promoted positivity and mass revolution, and #indiapositive has been a focal point of discussion. Prime Minister Modi emphasized that ""Mann Ki Baat"" is not about politics but about the society and the aspirations of the people, and it's a platform to honor the common man's talents and deeds. He also highlighted the importance of maintaining a dialogue with the youth, as they are driving transformative change in various fields. The Prime Minister announced the upcoming celebration of Guru Nanak Dev Ji's 550th birth anniversary and the construction of the Kartarpur corridor for pilgrims, highlighting the government's commitment to fostering unity and harmony. Finally, he thanked the listeners, media, and the ""Mann Ki Baat"" team for making the program a success and promised to continue this journey of connecting with the people.",25-nov-2018 my dear countrymen namaskar on the 3rd of october 2014 the pious occasion of vijayadashmi we embarked upon a journey together through the medium of mann ki baat this journey has reached its 50th episode today thus this golden jubilee episode is indeed gilt edged in every sense of the term your letters and phone calls this time pertain mostly to these 50 episodes anshu kumar amar kumar from delhi on mygov vikas yadav from patna on similar lines monica jain from delhi prosenjit sarkar from bardhaman west bengal and sangeeta shastri from nagpur converge in asking a shared question they are of the view that broadly speaking their prime minister being associated with the latest in technology social media and mobile apps why did he choose radio as a medium to connect with his countrymen your curiosity is but natural in this age when radio was fading into oblivion why did modi opt for the airwaves let me quote an incident the year was 1998 i was then a party worker with the bharatiya janata party organization in himachal it was the month of may and i was travelling to a certain place evenings tend to get cold in the hilly terrain of himachal pradesh and i stopped by at a wayside tea stall and placed an order for tea it was a tiny joint there was only one person who would make serve tea he was not even adequately clad it was a standalone kiosk on the edge of the road he first picked up a laddoo from a glass container offered the sweetmeat to me said sir eat this before the tea get ready i was taken aback and asked him what is the matter is it in celebration of an occasion like a wedding he replied no brother nothing like that don t you know it s a momentous joyous occasion on seeing his rather jubilant exuberance i asked him but what exactly happened and he replied india has exploded the bomb today i exclaimed india has exploded the bomb i don t get it said he sir just listen to the radio indeed that exactly was the topic of discussion on the radio it was then that he elaborated on how on the day of the nuclear test the then prime minister atal bihari vajpayee had announced to the media and how he broke into a dance on listening to it on the radio it was matter of great intrigue to me to see a lone tea seller in a remote snow clad hilly place who possibly kept listening to the radio the entire day watching that particular effect of the news on radio led me to realize internalise that this was a medium that was truly connected with the masses and that it was a mighty means of getting across in terms of the reach depth of communication radio has been incomparable i have been nursing that feeling ever since acknowledging its power strength hence when i became the prime minister it was natural for me to turn towards a strong effective medium and in 2014 when i took charge as the pradhan sevak principal servant it was my wish to reach out to the masses with the glorious saga of our country s unity her grand history her valour india s diversity our cultural diversity virtues embedded in our society such as purusharth tapasya passion sacrifice in a nutshell the great story of india from remote villages to metro cities from farmers to young professionals the array just prompted me to embark upon this journey of mann ki baat every month we would read letters to the tune of lakhs listen to phone calls watch comments on the app mygov weaving a common thread comprising them all into a fabric of informal conversation we have been able to travel together over this rather long distance of 50 episodes recently all india radio got a survey done on mann ki baat i came across some feedback that is very interesting out of the designated sample in the survey 70 of respondents on an average happen to be listeners who regularly tune in to mann ki baat most people believe that the greatest contribution of mann ki baat has been the enhancement of a feeling of positivity in our society the medium of mann ki baat has promoted many a mass revolution indiapositive has been the subject of quite an extensive discussion this is an exemplary glimpse of the feeling of positivity innate to our countrymen people have shared their experiences conveying the rise of selfless volunteerism as a consequence of mann ki baat it is a change where people are increasingly willing to contribute for the sake of service to society i am overjoyed on account of the fact that through mann ki baat radio is rising as a popular medium more than ever before but it s not about just radio people are connecting with this programme and ensuring their participation through t v fm radio mobile internet facebook live along with periscope through the narendramodiapp too i express my gratitude to the entire family of mann ki baat for being a part of it trusting it wholeheartedly phone call 1 thank you very much for your phone call your apprehension is not misplaced the fact is if a leader gets hold of a microphone with assured listeners to the tune of millions what else does he need significantly some young friends have attempted a study on the myriad subjects touched upon over the many episodes of mann ki baat they did a lexical analysis of all the episodes to calculate the frequency of occurrence of particular words whether there were some words that were oft repeated one of their findings was that this programme has remained apolitical when mann ki baat commenced i had firmly decided that it would carry nothing political or any praise for the government nor modi for that matter anywhere the greatest bulwark in ensuring adherence to my resolve in fact my highest inspiration have been you as a run up to each episode of mann ki baat the expectations aspirations of listeners through their letters online comments phone calls are crystal clear modi may come and go but this country will never let go of its unity permanence our culture will always be immortal these minute stories encompassing a 130 crore countrymen will always stay alive this new inspiration zest will keep taking her to greater heights at times when i look back i am taken aback sometimes people who write in from different corners of the country say we should not haggle beyond limits with marginal shopkeepers auto drivers vegetable sellers et al i read a letter then try to weave it with the essence of a similar letter i would like to share a couple of personal experiences with you who knows how soon these will reach our families who knows when social media will circulate them to usher in a revolution the stories that you ve sent across in the context of cleanliness myriad examples of common folk you never know where a tiny brand ambassador of cleanliness comes into being in various homes someone who reprimands elders at home or even admonishingly orders the prime minister through a phone call who would have imagined that a small campaign selfie with daughter starting from a small village in haryana would spread not only throughout the country but also across other countries as well every section of the society including celebrities joined in to ignite a process of transformation in a new modern language of change that the present generation understands and follows at times mann ki baat is also sneered at but 130 crore countrymen ever occupy a special pleace in my heart their heartsand my heart beat to the same rhythm mann ki baat is not about the government it is about the society mann ki baat addresses an aspirational india an ambitious india politics or political power are not intrinsic to the indian ethos on the contrary social values and society are in fact politics is one of the numerous other aspects of social life making politics an all pervasive powerful factor is not an effective way for a healthy society at times political developments and political people assume such overriding prominence that other talents and courageous deeds get overshadowed for ensuring a bright future for a country such as india it isour collective responsibility to acknowledge and honour the common man s talent and deeds and mann ki baat is a humble and modest effort in this direction phone call 2 promita manythanks for your phone call in a way your question were the a personal amiable touch i believe that the biggest achievement of the 50 episodes of mann ki baat is that one feels like talking to a close acquaintance and not to the prime minister and this is true democracy if i reply to the question asked by you straightaway then i will say that i do not make any preparation actually mann ki baat is a very simpletask for me every time before mann ki baat letters are received from people people share their ideas and view points on mygov and narendra modi mobile app and there is also a toll free number 1800117800 and by calling on this number people record messages in their own voice my effort is that i read the maximum number of these letters and comments myself before mann ki baat i listen to many phone calls too andas the episode of mann ki baat draws closer i read ideas and inputs sent by you very minutely while travelling my countrymen stay in my heart every moment and that is how the writer s situation and ideas expressed in the letter become part of my thought process that letter does not remain a mere a piece of paper for me as it is i have spent close to 40 to 45 years as a travelling mendicant and have been to most of the districts in our country including the remotest once where i spent a lot of time that is why i am able to relate myself to the place and context of the letter then i note down facts like the name of the village and of the person honestly speaking mann ki baat carries my voice but the examples emotions and spirit represent my countrymen i thank every person contributing to mann ki baat there are lakhs of persons whose names i have not been able to include in mann ki baat but without any disappointment they continue to sendin their letters and comments i firmly believe that your ideas and your views will continue reaching me in even greater numbers and will help make mann ki baat more interesting effective and useful an effort is also made that the concerned department should pay attention to such letters and comments which somehow could not be included in mann ki baat i also thank my colleagues from all india radio fm radio doordarshan other tv channels and the social media it is due to their hard work that mann ki baat reaches maximum number of people the team from all india radio prepares each episode for broadcast in a number of regional languages some of them very aptly narrate in a voice and style resembling that of modi s in this way for those 30 minutes they become narendra modi i congratulate and thank those persons for their talent and skills i would request all of you also to kindly listen to this programme in your regional language as well i sincerely thank from the core of my heart my friends in the media who regularly telecast mann ki baat on their channels no political person is ever happy with the media he feels that he is getting a very little coverage or the coverage given to him is negative but many issues raised in mann ki baat have been adopted by the media issues such as cleanliness road safety drugs free india selfie with daughter have been taken up by the media and turn into campaigns tv channels made it the most watched radio programme i sincerely thank and congratulate the media without your contribution and cooperation this journey of mann ki baat would have been incomplete phone call 3 nidhi bahuguna nidhi ji many thanks for your phone call to tell you the truth i have no such secret what i am doing must be happening in families as well in simple words i may say that i try to cast myself into the mould of that young man and put myself under his conditions and try to adjust and match the wave length accordingly there are old baggage s of our own lives and when they do not come in the way it becomes easier to understand others sometimes our inhibitions or prejudices become a big hurdle in communication i prefer to understand the other man s point of view rather than going through the process of acceptance rejection and reaction my experience has been that by adopting this approach the other side also tries to come to our wave length rather than arguing or creating pressure in order to convince thereby removing the communication gap and both sides become co travelers in our journey of idea sharing none of the two even realizes that how and when one other s has abandoned its idea and accepted and owned the idea of the other side today s youths have this special quality that they won t do anything which they do not believe themselves and whenever they believe in something they follow that leaving everything else people generally talk of a communication gap between the elders and teenagers in the family in fact the scope of discussion with teenagers is quite limited in most of the families most of the time these talks remain limited to studies habits or life style and the do s and don ts an open discussion without any expectations is gradually on the decline and this too is a matter of concern communication will be more effective if we accept instead of expect and discuss instead of dismiss my effort is to have a continuous dialogue with the youth in various programmes or through social media i try to learn from whatever they are doing or whatever they are thinking they are storehouse of ideas they are extremely energetic innovative and focused i try to share the efforts and achievements of the youth as much as possible through mann ki baat there is a general complaint that the younger generation asks too many questions i say it is good that the youth ask questions it is good as it shows that they want to analyse everything from its very root some people say that the youth do not have patience but my belief is that the youth do not have any time to waste this is the point which helps the present day youth become more innovative because they want to accomplish things quickly we feel that the youths are very ambitious today and they plan big i feel it is good dream big and achieve bigger successes after all this is the new india some people say that the younger generation wants to accomplish a many things at a time i say what is wrong in it they do so because they are adept in multitasking if we just look around we find that it is the youth who are bringing in transformation of society in a big way may it be social entrepreneurship start ups sports or any other field those youth who have dared to ask questions and have had the courage to dream big if we put these ideas of our youthinto practice and provide them conducive environment to express themselves they surely will bring about a constructive and a positive change in the country they are already doing so my dear countrymen vineeta ji from gurugram has posted on mygov that in mann ki baat i should talk about the constitution day which falls on the26th november she says that this day is special because we are going to enter into the 70th year of our constitution adoption thank you very much for your suggestion vineeta ji yes tomorrow is the constitution day a day to remember those great personalities who drafted our constitution our constitution was adopted on 26th november 1949 the constituent assembly took 2 years 11 months and 17 days to accomplish this stupendous task of drafting the constitution just imagine these luminaries gave us such a comprehensive and detailed constitution within a period of just less than 3 years the extraordinary pace at which they drafted the constitution is an example of time management and productivity to emulate even today this also inspires us to accomplish our responsibilities within a record time the constituent assembly was an amalgamation of the great talents of the country each one of them was committed to provide a constitution to the country which empowers the people of india and enriches even the poorest of the poor the unique point in our constitution is that the rights and duties have been very comprehensively detailed a balance between these two in the lives of our citizens will take our nation forward if we respect the rights of others our rights will automatically get protected and similarly if we fulfill our duties then also our rights will get automatically protected i still remember that in 2010 when 60 years of the adoption of the constitution were being celebrated we had taken out a procession by placing our constitution atop an elephant this has been a memorable incident to increase awareness about our constitution among the youth and to connect them to the various aspects of the constitution in the year 2020 we shall complete 70 years as a republic and in 2022 we shall enter 75th year of our independence let us all take forward the values enshrined in our constitution and ensure peace progress and prosperity in our country my dear countrymen while talking about the constituent assembly the contribution of that great man cannot be forgotten who played a pivotal role in the constituent assembly this great man was none other than our revered dr baba saheb ambedkar his death anniversary or mahaparirvan divas falls on 6th december i on behalf of all countrymen pay my homage to baba saheb who gave the right to live with dignity to crores of indians democracy was embedded deep in baba saheb s nature and he used to say that india s democratic values have not been imported from outside what is a republic and what is a parliamentary system are nothing new to india he had made a very moving appeal in the constituent assembly that we have to safeguard our hard fought democracy till the last drop of our blood he also used to say that we indians may be from different background but yes we shall have to keep the national interest above all the other things india first was the basic doctrine of dr baba saheb ambedkar once again my humble tribute to revered baba saheb my dear countrymen two days back on 23rd november we all celebrated shri guru nanak dev jayanti and next year in 2019 we shall be celebrating his 550th prakash parv guru nanak dev ji always envisaged the welfare of entire humanity he always showed the path of truth work service kindness and amity to the society the country will observe guru nahak dev ji s 550th birth anniversary in a grand way its soothing colours will not only spread in india alone but will get sprinkled the world over all states and union territories have been requested to celebrate the occasion in a grand manner guru nanak dev ji s 550th prakash parv will be celebrated in a similar manner in all the countries of the world as well besides a train will be run on a route joining all the holy places connected with guru nanak dev ji recently while holding a meeting in this regard i remembered about of lakhpat saheb gurudwara this gurudwara suffered severe damage due to the devastating earth quake of 2001 in gujarat but the manner in which the local people joined hands with the state government in renovating it is an example even today the government of india has taken a significant decision of building kartarpur corridor so that our countrymen could easily visit kartarpur in pakistan to pay homage to guru nanak dev ji at that holy sight my dear countrymen we shall meet once again in the next episode after this 50th episode of mann ki baat and i am sure that in this episode of mann ki baat today i got an opportunity for the first time to talk to you about the spirit behind this programme because of your questions but our journey shall continue the more you connect with us our journey will gain greater depth providing satisfaction to one and all at times a question arises in the minds of people s as to what i achieved through mann ki baat i would like to say today that of the feedback of this programme one of the points that touches my heart most is when people tell me that when we sit with all our family members to listen to mann ki baat we feel that the head of our family is sitting with us and sharing his ideas with us when i heard this comment in a larger circle i felt satisfied to know that i am yours i am one amongst you i am with you you elevated me and in a way and in this way i will continue to remain connected with you as a family member through man ki baat your joys and sorrows are my joys and sorrows too

He thanked and paid tribute to the makers of the Indian Constitution, especially Dr BR Ambedkar, saying he played a pivotal role in drafting the Constituent Assembly. The prime minister also paid a tribute to Guru Nanak Dev in the address."
25-Oct-15,"In his Mann ki Baat address on October 25, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed various topics, starting with the 'Gandhi-Mandela' cricket series between India and South Africa. He congratulated the Akashwani center in Kannur for their efforts to engage citizens, particularly highlighting a student's initiative in Kerala to raise awareness about organ donation. Modi stressed the importance of organ donation, mentioning the need for more donors in India, especially given the vast demand. He praised the efforts of individuals, organizations, and states working toward promoting organ donation. The Prime Minister also emphasized the significance of the India-Africa Foreign Summit, inviting leaders from 54 African countries to foster stronger ties with India. Additionally, Modi mentioned the 'Clean India' campaign and the new initiatives to promote gold monetization, gold bonds, and the introduction of gold coins with the Ashok Chakra. He encouraged citizens to participate in the 'Run for Unity' race to commemorate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary and promote unity. The Prime Minister expressed his excitement about his upcoming trip to Britain, where he would inaugurate the house in London where Dr. B.R. Ambedkar once stayed and unveil the statue of Lord Vishweshwara. Finally, he thanked the citizens for their continued engagement through Mann ki Baat and wished them a happy Diwali and a prosperous new year.",25-oct-2015 namaskar to all my fellow citizens once again i have the opportunity of connecting with you through mann ki baat today the fifth one day cricket match is being played between india and south africa in mumbai this series has been named as the gandhi mandela series it is at an interesting point with both teams having won 2 matches each so the last game is significantly important my best wishes to all the players today i would like to congratulate the friends at the kannur centre of akashwani i started the mann ki baat and people started connecting with it one of them was shraddha thamban from kerala a grade 12 student kannur centre invited her for a ceremony and a lot of feedback was received it created an environment of belonging kannur centre appreciated the awareness of shraddha and she was rewarded the development at kannur centre inspired me i wish all the akashwani centers pay attention to raise the level of awareness among the members and make them active in their region so that our aim of governance with public participation gets a boost my heartfelt greetings and congratulations to the team at kannur station of akashwani centre for their efforts i would like to talk about kerala again the girl students from saint mary upper primary school from chittoor in kerala have sent me a letter this letter is special in many ways firstly these girls have created an image of mother india by thumb prints on a huge piece of cloth they have sent me the image of mother india initially i was surprised to see why they created a map of india using thumb prints but when i read their letter i realized how beautifully a symbolic message was given it is not as if these girls have tried to just awaken the prime minister alone they are trying to create awareness among the people in their region and their mission is organ donation they are organizing a public awareness campaign for organ donation they have organized plays for creating an understanding about organ donation organ donation should become a habit as well as an instinct they have asked me in their letter to appeal to people about organ donation in mann ki baat the octogenarian vasantrao sudke guru ji from maharashtra has been running a movement from a long time he says that organ donation should be a celebrated as a festival these days i get a lot of messages on phone calls also devesh from delhi gas also sent me a similar message i am very happy with the government s initiative on the organ donation and steps towards creating a policy on the same the country really needs support in these things where people need to go out and help each other and the ambitious target of one per million organ donation is a very productive steps taken by the government i feel that this topic is very important the country needs more than 2 5 lakh kidneys hearts and livers for donation per year however in a country with 125 crore people only 5000 transplants could take place each year about one lakh eyes are in need of a vision and we are able to reach upto only 25 000 people who need it it implies that we are able to provide eye transplant services to only one out of the four needy persons we should also know that if someone is killed in a road accident then also the organs can be donated there are some legal hassles involved and efforts have been made to guide the states in this direction by reducing the paper work some of the states have made a good effort in speeding up the process involved in organ donation today i can say that tamil nadu today ranks first in the field of organ donation many social organizations and ngo s are doing commendable job in this direction national organ and tissue transplant organization noto has been established to encourage organ transplant a 24 7 helpline facility is also available its number is 1800 114 770 and there is a saying tain tyakten bhunjhita what is given by him allotted to you you enjoy that the joy of sacrifice is beautifully described in this mantra tain tyakten bhunjhita in the past few days we saw on television that the wife of a poor hawker in delhi received a transplant in delhi s g b pant hospital this liver was brought from lucknow by making special arrangements the transplant was successful a life was saved organ donation is the biggest donation let us all realize the mantra of tain tyakten bhunjhita dear countrymen we recently celebrated the festival of navratri and vijayadashmi and after some days we will celebrate diwali too we celebrated eid and ganesh chaturthi too but amongst all these another big festival is being organized which all our countrymen should be proud of in the national capital of delhi an india africa foreign summit is being organized from 26th to 29th october for the first time a program of this scale is being organized on the indian soil leaders of 54 african countries and unions have been invited this is the biggest conference of african countries outside africa india africa ties are deep the african nations have a population equal to that of india if both are combined together they make for a third of the world population and it is said that lakhs of years ago it was all one landmass later from the indian ocean two parts got separated there are a lot of similarities amongst us the bio diversity of both the nations is similar our natural resources are similar and almost 27 lakh indians have settled in these nations from a long time india shares a lot of economic cultural and political ties with the african nations but india plays the largest role in training the youth of the african countries more than 25 000 african youths have studied human resource development and capacity building in india and many leaders from africa have studied in india so you can understand the depth of our relationship and from that perspective this summit is very important generally when there is a summit leaders of various countries meet similarly in this summit the leaders will be meeting we are making efforts that the people should also meet and this time the government of india especially the hrd ministry has done something really commendable an essay competition was organized among all the cbse affiliated schools a poetry competition was organized to increase their participation almost 1600 schools participated in the event it included schools within and outside india and thousands of children wrote on topics about strengthening the indo africa ties on the other hand a mobile exhibition called memories of mahatma starting from his birth place porbandar and travelling through north is about to reach delhi on 29th october lakhs of school children enjoyed this exhibition the villagers also had a glimpse people realized the importance of the role of mahatma gandhi in developing the ties of both india and africa and also the effect of his personality on these nations some excellent creations were received in this competition one of the creations drew my attention and i want to share it with you it reflects the talent the broad vision and the depth of thoughts of students from small cities garima gupta from muzzafarnagar up writes beautifully and says the river in africa is nile and the name of the sea is red the continent is huge and the indian diaspora happy like the indus valley is recognition of india civilization river nile and carthage are synonymous with african civilization gandhi ji started his revolution in africa he wove a spell and won everybody s heart be it johannesburg or kingston zimbabwe or chad in each african nation we can find our aloo chat to write a thousand lines can be written but i want to mention that i love african jungles the poem is very long but i have read a few lines to you though it is an indo africa summit but how this too can become an opportunity to connect people is clearly evident here i heartily congratulate garima the students and more than 1600 schools who participated and hrd ministry for this initiative last time on 15th august i had proposed the sansad adarsh gram yojana since then many parliamentarian friends have adopted it they were deeply involved last month a workshop was organized in bhopal all the pradhans collectors parliamentarians of villages adopted under adarsh gram the representatives of indian government and state government all had an in depth discussion on this program many new and encouraging things came to our attention i would like to bring to your attention a few things jharkhand a huge state is primarily tribal unfortunately whenever one talks of jharkhand what comes to mind is maoism violence guns and blood soaked land many regions in the state have been ruined by these communist terrorists but the mp from that place a senior member who has also been our deputy speaker shri karia munda has dedicated his life for the tribals he chose parsi gram panchayat from khunti district to be adopted for adarsh gram it is difficult for government officials to go to places ruled by the maoists even the doctors cannot visit those places he himself started travelling to this village to instill faith and give a new lease of life to governmental organizations he encouraged the officials to visit he tried to change the mood of despondency and create a mood to achieve something a successful effort has been made in parsi village to create awareness along with infrastructure and organizational development i would like to congratulate our honourable parliamentarian sri karia munda ji for the same i got similar information from andhra too the mp from andhra sri ashok gajapati raju became involved in this plan and chose dwarapudi gram panchayat from vijaynagram district for the same other arrangements are in progress but he did something really innovative he gave a task to the students in the village school the new generation in the village is fortunate to be educated but the older generation is not literate so he asked the students of a higher age group to educate the parents so in the morning they are students and by evening they become educators and so nearly 550 adults were taught by these children and made literate just see no budget no circular no special arrangements but just will power brought about such a big change this is amply demonstrated by the dwarapudi gram panchayat similarly another respectable parliamentarian sri c l ruwala ji he is an mp from mizoram our north east he chose khwalahilung village for adarsh gram and ran a special initiative this village is famous for sugarcane production and a kurtayi jaggery sri ruwala ji started a sugarcane festival on 11th march all the people from the region came together for it senior members from social public life retired government officials from the region also participated they put up an exhibition on increasing sugarcane production they discussed how the village could be made the centre of economic activities and how it could market for its produce i congratulate ruwala ji for his efforts to make this village not only an adarsh gram but self dependent village too my dear brothers and sisters it is not possible that there be an episode of mann ki baat and we do not discuss cleanliness savita rai from mumbai has sent me a telephonic message each year on diwali we clean our houses this diwali let us clean our environment along with our homes and maintain that cleanliness even after diwali she has drawn attention to this issue i want to remind you my dear countrymen that last year in our country the media ran a special campaign and showed all the places where crackers were lying and told that it was not the right thing this was an awareness campaign launched by the media as a result of it soon after diwali a cleanliness drive got initiated all by itself so what you are saying is true that our concern before and after the festival should be the same and we should express this concern on every public platform and today i especially congratulate all the members of the indian media fraternity this 2nd october on gandhi ji s anniversary and also on the completion of one year of clean india campaign i had the fortune of participating in the safaigiri campaign of the india today group they gave away the clean india awards and i could see several initiatives being carried out different people were working as one like one mission there are so many places in our country that have been kept so clean all these things were brought to light and i offered my heartfelt appreciation to india today group for their commendable efforts since the inception of the cleanliness drive i have seen that from andhra and telangana etv eanadu have participated whole heartedly and specially sri ramoji rao who is very aged but beats any youth in his enthusiasm he has made cleanliness his personal program his mission he has been promoting the cleanliness program through etv for the past one year the newspapers carry news about them and he has emphasized on positive news about cleanliness he has been successful in bringing together around 51 lakh children from 55 56 thousand schools of andhra and telangana to this mission be it public places stations religious places hospitals parks or other places he ran a cleanliness drive all these news exhibit the power to realize the dream of a clean india abp news has started a program called ye bharat desh hai mera in this program they have shown how people have become aware towards cleanliness and through this they are trying to train people about keeping their surroundings clean ndtv has started a campaign called banega swachh india dainik jagaran has also encouraged this campaign so has zee tv and india tv also started mission clean india thousands of channels and newspapers in our country i am unable to name them all due to time constraints but they all have helped run this campaign this is why savita rai ji the suggestion that you have given us the whole nation has taken it upon them to do this work and taking it forward the governor of meghalaya mr shanmuganthan wrote me a letter and talked about a village in meghalaya called mavalyannong he has written that from last many years this village has set out on a mission for cleanliness and more or less every generation is completely dedicated towards this cause he has also mentioned that a few years ago they also got the award for the cleanest village of asia the idea of a far flung village situated in the north eastern region in meghalaya which has been particular about cleanliness since years makes me extremely happy this has become the habit and the culture of the village this is what reinforces our belief that our nation will be clean one day for sure this will be possible because of the efforts of the people and by the time we celebrate the 150th anniversary of mahatma gandhi the 125 crore people of the country should be able to proudly proclaim that we have made india clean my dear countrymen i said this from the red fort on the 15th of august that there are few places where corruption is deep rooted when a poor man goes for an ordinary job he faces so many problems to get a decent reference and has to go through a team of agents who take money from him in exchange for the position he is applying for he loses money whether he gets the job or not we keep hearing things like these and this is when i had an idea why do we need to interview people for ordinary jobs i have never heard of any psychologist in the world who can analyze a person completely in a 1 2 minute long interview with this thought i decided to do away with the tradition of interviews for small positions my dear young friends i feel very proud to tell you all that the government has completed all the formalities and now there will not be any interview for the non gazetted posts of group d group c and group b in the central government this will come into effect from january 1st 2016 we will not interrupt the ongoing procedures now but from january 1st 2016 this will come into play so let me congratulate all my young friends for the same we had anyways declared an important scheme in the last budget in our country gold has become a part of our social life gold is considered the medium of financial security gold is considered to be the solution for difficult times this has been an age old tradition i don t believe that anyone can reduce this love for gold that we have developed but keeping gold as dead money does not suit today s generation gold can become our strength it can become our financial strength gold can become the financial property of the nation and every indian must contribute to this i am happy that the promise that we made of introducing important schemes we will do so around diwali and dhanteras when people buy specially buy gold we have introduced a gold monetization scheme under this scheme you can deposit your gold in a bank and the bank will give you interest same as you deposit your money and get interest from the bank earlier we used to keep our gold in the lockers and paid for the lockers ourselves now when you keep your gold in the bank the bank will give you money as interest now tell me countrymen can gold become a property or not can gold be converted from dead money to a live strength or not this is exactly what we have to do and you must stand with me do not keep your gold in your homes avail dual benefits its security and interest on the gold you must avail this opportunity another thing is in sovereign gold bonds you do not really get a physical gold in your hand you get a sheet of paper and the value of that paper is equivalent to that of the amount of gold and the day you return that paper you will get the amount that is equivalent to the value of gold on that particular day let us assume you buy a gold bond worth rs 1000 and five years later you go to return that bond and at that time the rate of gold is rs 2500 you will receive an amount of rs 2500 in exchange of that bond so we are introducing this scheme now due to this scheme we will not have to buy gold now we will not have to secure our gold now we will not have to worry about where to put the gold and no one will come to steal the papers in the coming week i will certainly put forward this scheme that guarantees security to the people of this country i feel very glad to tell you that we are also introducing gold coin a gold coin with ashok chakra it has been around 70 years of independence but we are still using a foreign gold coin only or the gold bullion bars these are also used by the foreigners why should it not have the national emblem of our country this is why we are introducing it in the market and it will be available for the citizens in the coming week before dhanteras 5gm and 10gm of gold coins with ashok chakra are being introduced along with it a 20 gm gold gunion will also be available for the people i have full faith that this new scheme will usher a new change in the financial development of the country and i will get your support in this my dear countrymen 31st october is the birth anniversary of the iron man of india sardar vallabh bhai patel ek bharat shreshtha bharat a complete layout of india unfolds in front of us when we talk about sardar vallabh bhai patel this great man has contributed a lot in building the unity of india he has proven his capabilities as the iron man of india we will certainly pay tribute to sardar sahab but along with that his dream of seeing india integrated he made it possible geographically but this mantra of unity should be a continuously present in our thoughts in our minds behaviour and our expressions india is full of diversities many sects communities languages castes attires and it is this diversity that adds to its charm if it was not for this diversity we wouldn t have been this proud of our country this is why diversity is the mantra of unity peace social harmony unity these are essential elements of a society since last many years run for unity programs have been organized in various parts of the country on the 31st of october ekta ki daud i also had a chance to run in one of these earlier i have heard this year also this race is being planned at many places people are excited to be preparing for this race in the true sense ekta ki daud is the true race for development in other words the guarantee for the race of development lies in the race of unity come let us pay tribute to sardar sahab let us take forward the mantra of unity dear brothers and sisters you must all be busy in the preparations for diwali houses must be getting cleaned you must be shopping for new things the festival of diwali is celebrated in various ways all over the country i extend my good wishes to you on this pious festival we also get to hear of a few accidents around the time of diwali fire breaks out due to firecrackers or lamps especially children suffer a lot because of fire crackers i will suggest all the parents to be careful along with enjoying diwali and see to it that the kids should not get hurt or any untoward incident should not happen and we lose our child due to accidents i know you will be careful about this and of course about keeping the environment clean my dear countrymen i have to leave for a trip to britain on the next day of diwali i am very excited about my britain trip this time there is a reason behind my excitement a few weeks back i went to mumbai to inaugurate a magnificent memorial of dr baba bhimrao ambedkar near his chaitya bhoomi now i am going to london to formally inaugurate the house where babasaheb used to stay which has now become the property of india an inspiration for 125 crore countrymen be it a dalit an underprivileged a victim a bereaved or any indian who is leading a difficult life this house inspires us to believe in the fact that if one has a strong will power we can overcome the difficulties to tread on the path of success one can get educated and this is the very place where babasaheb ambedkar used to meditate the indian government and the government of different indian states give scholarships to such promising students who go abroad to study and who belong to the dalit community the tribal community or any other under privileged community i believe that when these kids go to britain to study this memorial of babasaheb will become a pilgrimage for them it will become a source of inspiration whatever you learn in life you must use it later for the nation and live for your nation babasaheb gave this message and even lived it himself this is why i am saying that i am very excited about my britain trip this time this issue has been lying entangled since many years now it has become the property of 125 crore countrymen and if the name of babasaheb ambedkar is attached you can imagine how happy it makes me i am going to get another opportunity in london the unveiling of the statue of lord vishweshwara many years ago what lord vishweshwara had done for democracy and empowerment of women can make for a very good subject to study in the world the unveiling of the statue of lord vishweshwara on the land of london is in itself a perfect example of the fact that the great men of india were very far sighted now you see when such incidents are connected how excited we get my dear countrymen you are connected with us through mann ki baat i keep getting your suggestions through telephone and mygov in your letters are also discussed on akashvani government officials are called in and discussions are held some people write down their grievances there are efforts to solve their problems as well we should learn more than one language in a country like india i am fortunate enough to have learned a few languages but still there are so many languages that i could not learn i am indebted to akashvani because they broadcast this program of mann ki baat by 8 o clock in every state in their regional languages even though a different voice is used but the thoughts are mine i will try to make it reach out to you in your language we have formed a beautiful bond between us last time i had completed a year in power this year we are entering a new year a heartfelt congratulations to all my countrymen once again jai hind ,namaskar to all my fellow citizens i have the opportunity of connecting with you through mann ki baat today the fifth one day cricket match is being played between india and south africa in mumbai this series has been named as the gandhi mandela series it is at an interesting point with both teams having won 2 matches each
25-Oct-20,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on October 25, 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended Dussehra greetings, emphasizing the festival's message of triumph of truth and patience over crises, especially during the ongoing fight against COVID-19. He called on citizens to celebrate festivals with restraint and remember essential workers, security forces, and soldiers stationed at the borders. PM Modi encouraged the ""Vocal for Local"" initiative when shopping for festival items and urged citizens to prioritize local products. He highlighted the increasing global popularity of Indian khadi and the Khadi movement, mentioning the success of Khadi in Oaxaca, Mexico. The Prime Minister also acknowledged the role of local libraries and individuals who promote reading and learning, including Pon Mariyappan, who established a library in his salon. Modi expressed the importance of unity and national integration, honoring the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and emphasizing that unity is the key to the country's progress. He also celebrated Maharishi Valmiki's contributions to society and remembered the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The Prime Minister recognized the significant role played by Pulwama in pencil manufacturing and praised Manzoor Ahmad Alai's entrepreneurial journey. He shared inspiring stories about technology-based service delivery and efforts to empower farmers through modern agricultural practices. PM Modi concluded by urging citizens to celebrate festivals while adhering to COVID-19 safety measures.",25-oct-2020 my dear countrymen namaskar today is the festival of vijaydashami that is dussehra on this auspicious occasion heartiest greetings to all of you the festival of dussehra is one of the triumph of truth over untruth but simultaneously it is also the festival of victory of patience over crises today all of you are carrying on with immense patience celebrating the festival with restraint and hence in our ongoing fight our victory too is assured earlier people used to throng durga pandals for a darshan of maa the atmosphere would be almost that of a carnival but it was not possible this time earlier grand fairs used to be held on the occasion of dussehra but in present times they took on a different form the festival of ramleela too was one of its major attractions but now that too has been restricted to some extent earlier during navratra the notes of garba of gujarat would reverberate all over this time all grand events have been curtailed many more festivals are on the way in the days to come there is eid sharad poornima valmiki jayanti followed by dhanteras diwali bhai dooj the pooja of chatthi maiyya and the birth anniversary of guru nanak dev ji during this crisis laden period of corona we have to exercise patience observe restraint friends when we talk about festivals and make preparations for them the first thought that strikes us is when to go to the market what all has to be purchased children especially are enthusiastic about it wondering what they would receive this time in the festival season the fervour of festivals and the glitter and sparkle of the marketplace are interconnected but this time when you go shopping do remember our resolve of vocal for local while purchasing items from the market we have to accord priority to local products friends amid the gaiety of festivities we should spare a thought for the lockdown period during the lockdown we closely came to know about those members of society without whom our lives would be miserable sanitation workers brothers and sisters working as domestic helps local vegetable vendors milkmen security guards we have now felt the significance of their roles in our lives in a better way during the moment of crisis they were with you they stood by all of us now during the festivities amid the rejoicing we must take them along i earnestly urge you to ensure in whatever way in making them a part of your celebrations treat them as members of your own family you will see for yourself how your joy rises by leaps and bounds friends we must also think of our braveheart soldiers who are firmly stationed on our borders in the line of duty even during these festive times all in the service and security of mother india we have to celebrate our festivals bearing them in mind we have to light a lamp at home in honour of these brave sons and daughters of mother india i would also like to assure our brave soldiers that despite they being away at the borders the entire country is with them wishing well for them i also salute the sacrifice of those families whose sons and daughters are on the border today i express gratitude to each and every person who is away from home and family on account of discharging duty to the country in one way or the other my dear countrymen today when we are going vocal for local the whole world are also becoming a fan of our local products many of our local products have the potential of becoming global one such example is khadi khadi has remained a symbol of simplicity over a long period of time but now our khadi is getting known as an eco friendly fabric in terms of health this is a body friendly fabric an all weather fabric and now it has also become a fashion statement not only is the popularity of khadi rising it is also being produced in many places of the world there is a place in mexico called oaxaca there are many villages in this area where the local villagers weave khadi today the khadi of this place has gained popularity by the name oaxaca khaadi how khadi reached oaxaca is no less interesting in fact a young person of oaxaca mark brown once watched a movie on mahatma gandhi brown got so inspired by watching this movie on bapu that he visted bapu s ashram in india understood him and learnt about him in depth it was then that brown realised that khadi was not just a cloth it was a complete way of life brown was deeply moved by the way khadi was intertwined with the rural economy and self sufficiency it was here that brown resolved to work on khadi on his return to mexico he introduced the villagers of oaxaca in mexico to khadi and trained them and now oaxaca khadi has become a brand the website of this project bears the inscription the symbol of dharma in motion you can also find a very interesting interview of marc brown on this website he narrates that initially the people were wary of khadi but ultimately they got interested and a market got ready for it he states that these are matters related to ram rajya when you fulfill the needs of the people the people start connecting with you friends this time on gandhi jayanti the khadi store in cannaught place at delhi witnessed purchases of over one crore rupees in just a day similarly the khadi masks have also become very popular during corona self help groups and other such institutions are making khadi masks in many places of the country there is a woman suman devi ji in barabanki of u p suman ji alongwith her friends of a self help group started making khadi masks gradualy more and more women started joining her and now together they are producing thousands of khadi masks our local products have this beauty that often a complete philosophy is enshrined in them my dear countrymen when we take pride in our own things the world s curiosity around them also grows just like our spirituality yoga ayurveda has attracted the whole world many of our indigenous sports also attract attention the world over nowadays our mallakhambh too is gaining popularity in many countries when chinmay patankar and pragya patankar decided to teach mallakhambh out of their home in america little did they know how successful it would be mallakhambh training centers are running at many locations across america a large number of american youth are joining and learning mallakhambh be it germany poland or malaysia mallakhambh is becoming popular in around 20 other countries and now its world championship has also been started which sees participants from many countries ancient india had many such sports which would bring about extraordinary growth within oneself they give new dimensions to our mind and body balance however probably our young friends of the new generation are not that acquainted with mallakhambh do search more about it on the internet and see for yourself friends our country has many forms of martial arts i would like our young friends to know more about them learn them and over the course of time bring about innovations in the same when there are no major challenges to face in one s life the best of one s personality also fails to surface hence always keep on challenging yourselves my dear countrymen it is said that learning is growing today in mann ki baat i will introduce you to a person who has a novel passion this is the passion of sharing the joys of reading and writing with others he is pon mariyappan from thoothukudi in tamil nadu thoothukudi is also known as the pearl city once it was an important centre of the pandyan empire my friend from this town pon marriyappan is associated with the profession of hair cutting and runs a salon a very small salon he has done an exemplary and an inspiring piece of work he has converted a small portion of his salon into a library if a customer while waiting for his turn reads something from the library and writes on that pon marriyappan offers him a discount isn t it intresting come lets go to thoothukudi lets talk to pon mariyyapan ji p m pon marriyyapan ji vannakaam how are you pon respected prime minister vanakkam p m vanakkam vanakm how did you get the idea of this library pon mariyappan i have studied up to class 8th i could not further my studies beyond that due to family circumstances when i see educated people i feel something amiss in me so i thought why not establish a library which would benefit many people this became an inspiration for me prime minister which book do you like a lot pon mariyappan thirukkural is very dear to me prime minister i felt very happy talking to you best wishes to you pon mariyappan i too am feeling extremely happy while talking to respected prime minister prime minister best wishes pon mariyappan thank you prime minister ji prime minister thank you we just spoke to pon mariyappan ji see how he dresses people s hair he gives them an opportunity to dress up their lives too it felt nice to learn about the popularity of thirukkural all of you too heard about the populairity of thirukkural today thirukkural is available in all languages of india given an opportunity one must read it in a way it is a guide for life friends but you will be happy to know that all over india there are several people who get immense happiness spreading knowledge these are people who are always eager to get everyone inspired to study a teacher from singrauli in madhya pradesh usha dubey ji in fact has turned a scooty into a mobile library every day she goes to some village or the other with her mobile library and teaches children there children lovingly call her kitabon waali didi the elder sister with books this year in august at rayo village in nirjuli of arunachal pradesh a self help library has been set up in fact when meena gurung and dewang hosayi from this village learnt that there was no library in the area they extended a hand for its funding you will be surprised to know that there is no membership for this library anyone can borrow books for two weeks one has to return them after reading this library is open all seven days 24 hours parents around are quite happy that their children are busy reading books especially when schools too have started online classes in chandigarh sandeep kumar who runs an ngo has set up a mobile library in a mini van through which poor children are given books to read free of cost along with this i know two organisations in bhav nagar gujarat which are doing marvellous work of these one is vikas vartul trust this organisation is very helpful to students who are preparing for competitive exams this trust has been working since 1975 and provides 140 magazines along with 5000 books pustak parab is a similar organization this in an innovative project which provides literary books along with other books free of cost in this library books related to spirituality ayurvedic treatment and many other subjects also are included if you are aware of other such initiatives i urge you to certainly share that on social media these examples are not limited just to reading books or opening libraries but are also symbolic of that spirit of the new india where in every field people of every stratum are adopting innovative ways for the development of the society it has been mentioned in the geeta na hi gyanen sadrishyam pavitramih vidyate meaning there is nothing as sacred as knowledge in this world those who spread knowledge who take such noble initiatives i commend all such great people from the core of my heart my dear countrymen in a few days we will celebrate sardar vallabh bhai patel s birth anniversary the 31st of october as national unity day earlier too we have talked in detail on sardar patel in mann ki baat we have talked about the many dimensions of his great personality you will come across few people whose personality has so many elements depth of thoughts moral courage political genius in depth knowledge of the field of agriculture and spirit of commitment to national unity do you know of one thing that showcases the sense of humour of sardar pate just visualize the image of the iron man who was interacting simultaneously with kings and royalty managing the mass movements of revered bapu and also fighting against the british and in all these his sense of humour too was in full form bapu had said that the jestful banter of sardar patel made him laugh so much that he would get cramps in the stomach this happened not just once but several times during the day in it there is a lesson for us too keep alive your sense of humour irrespective of how difficult the situations are not only will this keep us at ease we will be able to find solutions to our problems this is exactly what sardar sahib did my dear countrymen sardar patel devoted his entire life for the unity of the country he integrated the indian public with the freedom movement he endeavored to connect the issues of farmers with independence he worked for the integration of the princely states with our nation he was invoking the mantra of unity in diversity in the mind of every indian friends today through our speech our bearing and our actions every moment we have to carry forward the entire spectrum of values that unite us so that a sense of ease and belongingness is inculcated in the mind of the citizen living in one part of the country for the citizen living in the other our ancestors have made these efforts incessantly for centuries now for example his holiness adi shankaracharya was born in kerala and established four important mathas in all four directions of india badrikashram in the north puri in the east sringeri in the south and dwarka in the west he also traveled to srinagar and that is the reason a shankracharya hill exists there pilgrimage in itself knits india in a common thread the chain of jyotirlingas and shaktipeethas binds india with the common thread our centres of faith established from tripura to gujarat and from jammu and kashmir to tamil nadu unite us as one the bhakti movement became a mass movement throughout india uniting us through bhakti devotion these elements with the strength of unity have been assimilated in our day to day lives the various rivers in our country are invoked before each ritual ranging from the indus located in the far north to the kaveri the lifeline of south india often people in our country say or chant while bathing with a hallowed belief the mantra of unity gangecheyamunechaive godavari saraswati narmade sindhu kaveri jale asminn sannidhim kuru similarly the holy sites of sikhs include nanded sahib and patna sahib gurdwaras our sikh gurus too have enriched the spirit of unity through their lives and noble deeds in the last century in our country we have had luminaries such as dr babasaheb ambedkar who forged unity among us all through the medium of the constitution friends unity is power unity is strength unity is progress unity is empowerment united we will scale new heights although there have also been forces which continuously try to sow the seeds of suspicion in our minds and try to divide the country the country too has given a befitting reply to these ill intentions every time we have to constantly try through our creativity and love to bring out the beautiful colors of ek bharat shrestha bharat even in the smallest of our tasks new colors of unity have to be filled in and every citizen must fill them in this context i urge all of you to visit a website ekbharat gov in this website displays our many efforts made to advance our campaign of national integration it also has an interesting corner the sentence for the day in this section we can learn how to speak a sentence in different languages every day you can also contribute to this website for example every state and its culture has different kinds of cuisines these dishes are made with special local ingredients comprising grains and spices can we share the recipe of these local foods along with the names of the local ingredients on the ek bharat shrestha bharat website what can be a better way to propagate unity and immunity friends on the 31stof this month i will have the opportunity to attend many events to be held in and around the historic statue of unity in kevadiya do connect with these my dear countrymen on the 31st of october we will also celebrate valmiki jayanti i pay my obeisance to maharishi valmiki and extend my heartiest greetings to the countrymen on this special occasion maharishi valmiki s lofty ideals continue to inspire millions of people and provide them strength he is a beacon of great hope for millions of the impoverished and dalits instills hope and trust within them he says that if anyone has will power one can achieve anything with ease it is this will power which provides the strength to many young people to do extraordinary things maharishi valmiki emphasized positive thinking for him the spirit of service and human dignity were of utmost importance maharishi valmiki s conduct thoughts and ideals are the inspiration and guiding force for our resolve for a new india we will always be grateful to maharishi valmiki for composing an epic like ramayana to guide the future generations on the 31st of october we lost former prime minister of india smt indira gandhi i most respectfully pay my tributes to her my dear countrymen today pulwama in kashmir is playing an important role in educating the entire country today when children all over the nation do their homework or prepare notes somewhere behind this lies the hard work of the people of pulwama the kashmir valley meets almost 90 demand for the pencil slats timber casings of the entire country and of that a very large share comes from pulwama once upon a time we used to import wood for pencils from abroad but now our pulwama is making the country self sufficient in the field of pencil making in fact these pencil slats of pulwama are reducing the gaps between states chinar wood of the valley has high moisture content and softness which makes it most suitable for the manufacture of pencils in pulwama oukhoo is known as the pencil village here several manufacturing units of pencil slats are located which provide employment and in these units a large number of women are employed friends pulwama gained this recognition when individuals of this place decided to do something new took risks and dedicated themselves towards it one such enterprising person is manzoor ahmad alai earlier manzoor bhai was a simple workman involved in woodcutting manzoor bhai wanted to do something new so that his coming generations wouldn t have to live in poverty he sold his ancestral land and established a unit to manufacture apple wooden boxes he was engaged in his small business when he came to know that poplar wood chinar wood is being used in manufacturing pencils after getting this information manzoor bhai channeled his entrepreneurial spirit and started the supply of poplar wooden boxes to some famous pencil manufacturing units manzoor ji found this to be extremely profitable and his income grew considerably at the same time with the passage of time he bought pencil slat manufacturing machinery and started the supply of pencil slats to some of the biggest companies of the country today manzoor bhai s turnover from this business is in crores and is a source of livelihood for around two hundred people today through mann ki baat i on behalf of all countrymen commend manzoor bhai and the enterprising brothers and sisters of pulwama along with their families all of you are making invaluable contribution in educating the young minds of our country my dear countrymen during the lockdown many instances of technology based service delivery were explored in the country and it is not that only the big technology and logistic companies are capable of the same a self help group of women in jharkhand have accomplished this feat these women worked to deliver vegetables and fruits to households directly from the fields of the farmers these women got an app ajivika farm fresh designed through which people could directly order vegetables to be delivered at their homes through this initiative the farmers were ensured of a fair price for their produce and fresh vegetables were also available for the buyers this idea of ajivika farm fresh app is gaining a lot of popularity there fruits and vegetables worth more than 50 lakhs were delivered by them during the lockdown friends with emerging possibilities in the agriculture sector more and more youth are now engaging themselves in this field atul patidar of barwani in madhya pradesh has connected four thousand farmers in his area through the digital medium through the e platform farm card of atul patidar farmers are now able to get the essentials of agriculture such as fertilizer seeds pesticide fungicide etc home delivered the farmers get what they need at their doorstep modern agricultural equipment is also available for hire on this digital platform even during lockdown thousands of packets containing seeds of cotton and vegetables were delivered to farmers through this digital platform atul ji and his team are working to impart technological knowhow to the farmers and also teaching them about online payment and procurement friends recently one incident in maharashtra caught my attention there one farmer producer company procured corn from the corn producing harvesters this time the company paid not just the cost of the corn but also an additional bonus with it this was a pleasant surprise for the farmers when the company was asked for the same they said that under the new farm specific laws framed by government of india farmers are able to sell their produce in any part of the country and are getting good prices for the same thus the company thought of sharing their extra profits with the farmers the farmers had a right to it and hence the bonus was shared with them friends the bonus amount may be small but this initiative is big through this we come to know that on ground the new agriculture laws are full of possibilities in favour of the farmers my dear countrymen in today s

recently lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in uri sector in jammu and kashmir i salute these valiant soldiers and pay my tributes to them this cowardly act has shocked the entire nation there are strong emotions of widespread grief as well as anger across the country and this is not only a loss for the families who have lost a son a brother or a husband in fact it is a national loss and therefore i will just reiterate to you my countrymen what i had said that very day that the guilty will certainly be punished my dear countrymen we have full faith in our armed forces they will foil with their valour every such conspiracy and they are the ones to reach the pinnacle of bravery so that we their 1 25 billion fellow countrymen can live peacefully and be happy we are proud of our army we politicians have many opportunities to speak our mind and we do speak but the forces do not speak they take action i also wish today to specially talk to those living in kashmir kashmiris are now beginning to recognize well the true face of the anti national forces and as they understand the truth better they are now separating themselves from such elements and have started moving on the path of peace every parent wants the schools and colleges to be functioning properly at the earliest farmers also feel that their ripened crops and fruits should reach markets across the country economic activities too should be back on track and during the last few days there has been a movement towards restoration of trading activities we all know that peace unity and harmony are the only way to solve our problems and also the way to our progress and development we have to scale greater heights of development for the sake of our future generations i am very sure that by sitting together we shall definitely find solutions to our problems find ways to move ahead and also pave a better path for future generations in kashmir providing security to people in kashmir is the responsibility of the administration the government has to take some steps to maintain law and order i shall also tell the security forces that all our capabilities power laws rules and regulations are basically meant to maintain law and order in order to provide a life of peace and happiness for the common people of kashmir we shall strictly abide by this at times people thinking differently from us also provide new ideas these days i get to learn quite a lot through social media i get an opportunity to know and understand views of different people from all corners of the country and this actually adds to the strength of our democracy recently harshvardhan a young student of eleventh class has put before me a different type of thought he has written i was very much distressed after the uri attack and strongly felt like doing something but i did not know how to go about it as what could a young student like me possibly do so i was trying to find some way to be of some service to the nation and i have resolved that i would devote three more hours daily towards my studies i shall become a capable citizen so that i can serve the country well brother harshvardhan i am happy to know that despite this atmosphere charged with anger you are able to think in a healthy manner at such a young age but dear harshvardhan i shall also like to add that the anger in the hearts of our countrymen is of a very high value it symbolises our national consciousness this anger has the resolve to do something yes you have presented that with a constructive approach but you must be aware that during the 1965 war lal bahadur shastri ji was leading us and then also similar feelings of rage anger and patriotic fervour were sweeping the nation everyone wanted that something must happen must be done then lal bahadur shashtri ji had very aptly tried to touch the emotional universe of the country he gave the mantra jai jawan jai kisan which inspired the common people of the country to work for the nation lal bahadur shashtri ji showed that even amidst the deafening sounds of gunfire and bombardment there existed an alternative way for every citizen for expressing patriotism during the freedom movement mahatma gandhi also used to mount highly successful experiments to divert the strong energy of that movement towards constructive social work whenever a lull was needed amidst the extreme intensity in that movement now if all of us that is our armed forces people in the government fulfill our respective responsibilities sincerely and all of us countrymen each citizen make some constructive contribution imbued with the feeling of patriotism our country will most definitely scale greater heights my dear countrymen shri t s kartik has written on narendramodiapp that our athletes who participated in the paralympics have created a new history and their performance is a triumph of the human spirit shri varun vishwanathan has also written on narendramodiapp that our athletes did a commendable job and that i should talk about this in mann ki baat not only the two of you but each one of our countrymen has felt an emotional attachment with our athletes who participated at the paralympics perhaps going beyond sporting achievements these paralympics and the performance by our athletes have transformed our attitude towards humanity towards specially abled divyang people and i shall never be able to forget what our victorious sister deepa malik had to say when the medal was awarded to her she said through this medal i have actually defeated the disability itself there is great strength in this remark this time 19 athletes including three women took part in paralympics from our country compared to normal sporting activities when the divyang play in addition to physical ability and sporting skills what are needed even more are will power and resolve you will be pleasantly surprised to learn that our sportspersons put up their best ever performance this time and won 4 medals including two gold one silver and one bronze brother devendra jhajharia won the gold medal in javelin throw and repeated his gold winning performance after 12 years one gets older over a period of 12 years and after having won the gold medal once the passion for the same is also somewhat reduced yet devendra displayed that physical condition and increasing age could not dent his strong determination and he successfully claimed his second gold medal after a gap of 12 years and he was not born a divyang he lost one of his hands due to suffering electric current shock just think about the perseverance and the huge effort put in by him in repeating the feat of winning a second gold medal at 35 years of age 12 years after winning the first one at 23 mariyappan thangavelu won a gold medal in high jump thangavelu had lost his right leg when he was just 5 even poverty could not come in the way of his resolve he is not from a big city he does not come from a middle class or rich family yet despite facing all sorts of difficulties and physical challenges at the age of 21 through his unwavering determination he won the medal for the country as far as athlete deepa malik is concerned she has won laurels many a times by emerging victorious repeatedly varun c bhati won a bronze medal in high jump medals in paralympics have a significance of their own but going beyond that these medals have made a very big contribution in transforming the attitude towards our divyang brothers and sisters in our country our society and our neighborhoods these have not only inspired our empathy but also changed the way of looking at the divyang people only very few people might be knowing as to what stupendous feats were performed by these divyang people in the paralympics this time olympic games were held at the same venue only a few days ago can anyone ever imagine the divyang athletes breaking a record set during the general olympic games it happened this time in the 1500 meter race abdellatif baka of algeria set a new record by completing the 1500 meters race taking 1 7 seconds less than the time taken by the gold medalist in the same event at the general olympics not only this what really surprised me was the fact that the athlete who finished fourth in this event amongst divyang persons and thus missed winning any medal actually took less time than the gold medalist of general category in completing the race i once again congratulate all our paralympic athletes and india is progressing in the direction of preparing an effective plan for developing our athletes and also the facilities for the paralympics my dear countrymen last week i had many wonderful experiences in navsari gujarat it was a very emotional moment for me government of india had organized a mega camp for divyang persons and a number of world records were established that day a visually challenged little girl child gauri shardul hailing from far flung forest area in the dang district can recite the complete ramayana epic as she has learnt it by heart she rendered certain portions before me and when i presented her performance before other persons there everyone was amazed i got an opportunity to publicly release a book that day wherein success stories from the lives of some divyang persons had been compiled these were very inspiring incidents government of india created a world record in navsari which i believe to be very important the task of fitting hearing aids to 600 hearing impaired divyang people in just eight hours was completed successfully this deed found a mention in guinness book of world records three world records in a single day by divyang people is a matter of great pride for our countrymen my dear countrymen we had launched swachha bharat mission two years ago on 2nd october the birth anniversary of our revered bapu that day too i had said that cleanliness should become our nature a duty for every citizen and there should be an atmosphere harbouring a sense of revulsion against filth now it is going to be nearly two years on 2nd october and i can confidently say that one hundred and twenty five crore people of the country have now become more aware about cleanliness i had said one step towards cleanliness and today we can say that each one of us has definitely tried to take one step further this means that the country has taken 125 crore steps in the direction of achieving cleanliness this affirms that the direction we have taken is correct and also fruits of the action are very sweet it has also been seen as to how much can be achieved through making small efforts everyone be it a common citizen an administrator in government offices or roads bus stops or railways schools or colleges religious places hospitals from children to old persons rural poor farming women everyone is contributing something in achieving cleanliness friends in the media have also played a constructive role i also know that we still have to go much farther yet the beginning has been good so far whole hearted efforts have been made and a conviction has now set in that we shall indeed succeed this conviction is important if we talk of rural india so far 2 crore 48 lakh or say about two and a half crore toilets have been constructed and we intend to build another one and a half crore toilets in the coming one year from the point of view of sanitation and keeping in mind the dignity of our citizens especially the dignity of our mothers and sisters it is necessary to put an end to the habit of defecating in the open and with this in view open defecation free or odf campaign has been launched a healthy competition towards achieving liberation from the habit of defecating in open has started at the levels of states districts and the villages andhra pradesh gujarat and kerala will achieve very soon cent percent odf targets i visited gujarat recently and the officers there informed me that porbandar the birth place of mahatma gandhi will achieve the target of total odf on 2nd october 2016 my congratulations to those who have made it possible and best wishes to those who are trying to reach the target i appeal to all of my countrymen that to maintain the dignity of our mothers and sisters and for the sake of health of our children our country needs to get rid of this scourge let us forge ahead with a strong resolution i specially want to suggest a scheme to my young friends who are currently technology savvy every citizen has a right to know about the status of the cleanliness mission in his city and the government of india has provided a dedicated telephone number 1969 for this purpose we know that mahatma gandhi was born in 1869 in 1969 we celebrated his birth centenary and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi by dialing this number 1 9 6 9 you will be able to know the progress of construction of toilets in your city and will also be able to submit an application for construction of a toilet you must avail this facility not only this a cleanliness that is swachchhata app has been launched for people to lodge complaints concerning cleanliness and also to know about the progress in resolving these complaints please make full use of this facility especially the younger generation must utilize it optimally government of india has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward in this endeavour they can sponsor young professionals willing to work for swachchhata mission they can also be sent to various districts as swachchha bharat fellows it will not be sufficient to keep this cleanliness campaign confined to beliefs and habits imbibing cleanliness as a nature is not enough in this age just as cleanliness is related to health connecting cleanliness to a revenue model is also equally necessary waste to wealth should also be one of its components it is therefore imperative that we need to move towards waste to compost along with the cleanliness mission solid waste should be processed and be converted into compost and the government has initiated a policy intervention in this regard fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost made out of waste they should supply this to the farmers who are willing to adopt organic farming this should also be supplied to those farmers who care about the health of their soil and are willing to improve its quality and also to those farmers whose soil quality has deteriorated because of over use of chemical fertilizers and for this shrimaan amitabh bachchan ji is making a significant contribution as a brand ambassador i invite youngsters to set up new start ups also in this waste to wealth movement to develop the means and processes to develop the suitable technology and accomplish mass production at an affordable cost this is a task worth doing there is also a big scope of employment generation and an opportunity for tremendous economic activity and wealth creation from waste is achievable this year a special programme indosan india sanitation conference is being organized from 25th september to 2nd october ministers chief ministers as also mayors and commissioners of metropolitan cities will participate in brainstorming sessions on the sole issue of cleanliness what can be achieved with technology what can be the financial model how to mobilize public participation how can employment opportunities be increased in this sphere all these topics will be discussed and i see clearly that the news about cleanliness keeps pouring in i recently read in a newspaper that students of gujarat technological university launched a jagran abhiyan awereness campaign to build toilets in 107 villages they themselves put in physical labour and contributed significantly in constructing around 9000 toilets it might have come to your notice some time ago that under the leadership of wing commander param veer singh a team covered a distance of 2800 kilometres by swimming in ganga from dev prayag to ganga sagar to spread the message of cleanliness government of india has also chalked out an annual calendar for its departments each department is to focus exclusively on cleanliness for a period of 15 days in the coming october month from 1st october to 15th october drinking water and sanitation department panchayati raj department and rural development department these three are going to work under a designated roadmap in their respective areas then during last two weeks of october from 16th october to 31st october three more departments namely agriculture and farmer welfare food processing industries and consumer affairs are going to take up cleanliness campaigns in the concerned areas i request the citizens also to get involved wherever they feel that they too can pitch in these programmes you might have seen that a cleanliness survey campaign is also carried out these days earlier the cleanliness status was presented before the countrymen after conducting a survey of 73 cities now this survey will be conducted in about 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh each city will imbibe a sense of confidence that well we have lagged behind but we will surely perform better next time in this manner an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness has been created i expect that all of us citizens should contribute as much as we can in the cleanliness mission 2nd october is the birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi and lal bahadur shastri ji swachchh bharat mission is completing two years on this day i keep on urging everyone to buy some khadi items between gandhi jayanti to diwali this year also i request that each family should buy one or the other khadi item so that the poor may also be able to light an earthen lamp and celebrate diwali this year 2nd october is a sunday so can we involve ourselves in the cleanliness mission in some way you involve yourself physically for 2 hours 4 hours with cleaning work and i request you to share your cleanliness drive photo on narendramodiapp if it is a video then share the video you will see that with our joint efforts this movement will get a fresh boost a new dynamism let us all remember mahatma gandhi and lal bahadur shastri and take a pledge to do something for the country my dear countrymen one gets a special pleasure in giving one may not realize it but the pleasure of giving is divine i witnessed it some time back when i asked the countrymen to give up their cooking gas subsidy and they responded whole heartedly this in itself was a very inspirational event in india s national life now many youngsters small groups people from the corporate world schools and some ngos are jointly going to organize joy of giving week from 2nd october to 8th october under this campaign food items and clothes will be collected and supplied to the needy persons when i was in gujarat all our workers used to walk the streets seeking donations of old toys from families and then presented these toys to anganwadis in poor neighbourhoods these toys provided great pleasure to the poor children which was a great sight to behold i feel that we should encourage and help these young people who are organising joy of giving week in many cities this is a kind of a donation festival a daan utsav i convey my best wishes to all those young persons who are undertaking this mission my dear countrymen today is 25th september the birth anniversary of pandit deen dayal upadhyay ji and his birth centenary year commences from today pandit deen dayal upadhyay undertook the tremendous task of defining and elaborating upon the political ideology being followed by lakhs and lakhs of workers like me he was a supporter of a political ideology connected with the roots of india he presented his own soul stirring political philosophy the ekaatm maanav darshan alongside the ideology to uphold india s great cultural heritage the centenary year of pandit deen dayal upadhyay is commencing from today sarvajan hitay sarvajan sukhay the principle of antyoday these are his gifts to us mahatma gandhi also talked about the last man standing in the queue how can the poorest of the poor avail of benefits of development work for every hand water to every field through only these two words he presented his entire economic agenda the country should celebrate his centenary year as garib kalyan varsh year for welfare of the poor we can alleviate poverty when everyone including society and governments focuses attention on measures to provide benefits of development to the poor the place where i live was known as race course road since british rule but now in the centenary year of pandit deen dayal updhyay this has been named lok kalyan marg this is a symbolic representation of the year for the welfare of the poor the centenary year of pt deen dayal upadhyay i respectfully pay my homage to revered pandit deen dayal upadhyay who has been a source of inspiration to all of us and an embodiment of our intellectual heritage my dear countrymen i had started mann ki baat on vijayadashmi two years ago my sincere effort was that mann ki baat should not become a programme of praising and highlighting only government s achievements mann ki baat should not become a programme of political oneupmanship allegations and counter allegations and sometimes passionate advocacy despite numerous pressures during these past two years sometimes being tempted due the surrounding atmosphere at times with provocations to say something with indignation overcoming all such impulses over these two years with your blessings i have moved through these obstacles and earnestly tried to connect with the common man through mann ki baat how the common man of this country keeps on inspring me all the time what are the hopes and aspirations of the common man in the country and this common man who occupies my mind all the time always gets projected in mann ki baat for our countrymen mann ki baat may be a source of information for me mann ki baat has been the means to feel the strength of my 1 25 billion countrymen to recall their great capabilities and power and to draw inspiration from the same for my own endeavours and initiatives on completion of two years of mann ki baat this week i wish to express my sincere gratitude from the core of my heart to all you listeners who appreciated it who contributed to improving it and thus blessed me i am grateful to all india radio also which not only broadcast my views but also put in their best efforts to transmit it in all languages i am also thankful to those countrymen who knocked on the doors of the government by writing letters and by sending in suggestions and highlighting shortcomings of the government and all india radio mounted special programmes on these letters by inviting concerned government functionaries and thus provided a platform to address the problems thus mann ki baat became a new opportunity of social transformation rather than just remaining a mere talk show of 15 20 minutes what can be more satisfying than this for any one and therefore i thank everyone and express my gratitude to all who contributed in making it a successful programme my dear countrymen from next week festive season will be ushered in with navratri and durga puja vijayadashmi preparations for deepavali and all such activities this is an occasion for praying to shakti unity in society is the power or shakti of the country be it navratri or durga puja how can this shakti upasana become the festival of celebrating social unity how to make it a festival of social bonding and that would be the true prayer to shakti only then can we celebrate together the festival of victory let us bow before shakti nurture it march forward with the mantra of unity come let us celebrate navratri and durga puja festivals with peace unity and harmony to enable our nation to scale newer heights let us celebrate victory on vijayadashmi thank you very much 18 pm narendramodi mannkibaat pm pm narendramodi

He wished students well for their upcoming holidays and urged them to spend quality time with their families.",26-apr-2015 my dear countrymen namaskar i was not feeling like doing mann ki baat today i am feeling heavy and burdened and little distressed there were news of hailstorm unseasonal rains and damages to farmer s crop when i was talking to all of you last month suddenly out of nowhere strong winds blew in bihar causing death of so many people and inflicted lot of damages there and the earthquake has shaken the entire world on saturday it seems the trend of natural disasters has continued be it the nepal earthquake and in india as well the earthquake took lives across various states of india there has been loss of property because of the earthquake however the loss to nepal is frightening i have seen kutch earthquake very closely on jan 26 2001 i can clearly imagine how devastating these disasters are i can imagine what nepal and the victimized families there must be going through but my dear brothers and sisters of nepal india is with you in your hour of grief work has begun to provide assistance to people facing crisis across several locations in india and nepal first and foremost work is rescue operation to save people some people must still be alive under the debris and should get evacuated safely from there a team of experts which has been sent is specifically trained for this task sniffer dogs have been sent as they possess the ability to trace any individual staying alive under the debris our whole endeavour would be to save maximum number of people alive post rescue operation there is a need to undertake relief work as well rehabilitation work will also continue for long however humanity has a power of its own nepal is a dear to 125 crore people of india their grief is our grief india will make sure to wipe the tears of every nepali hold their hands and provide support to them thousands of our indian brothers and sisters were left stranded in yemen a few days ago it was a very tough task to evacuate the indians alive amidst horrific situation amidst the tension of bombs and guns amidst firing but we managed to do so not only this when we safely rescued a new born girl who was just a week old we felt how much power humanity has it brings a sense of satisfaction to the mind by rescuing a week old girl alive amidst raining bombs guns and shadow of death wherever i went overseas in the last few days i received compliments for one thing and that was for saving citizens of 48 countries of the world in yemen be it the citizen of the us the uk france russia germany japan we helped the citizen of every country and due to this the world has experienced the old saying of india meaning the greatest service to humanity is to serve others our ministry of external affairs our air force and our navy have done this work with such courage and responsibility that it will have indelible imprint over the world in the coming days this is what i believe in and i am happy that all the people were evacuated safely without any damage and it should be noted that india s special quality is that our culture is quite old recently when i visited france i went to a memorial of the first world war there the reason for visiting the place was that it is the centenary year of the first world war but at the same time it is the centenary year of india s valour this is the centenary year of the sacrifices made by the indian heroes and meaning the greatest service to humanity is to serve others and how this phrase has been lived by our country this year is a centenary year for this reason also i am saying this because very few people would know that about 15 lakh indian soldiers had put their life at stake during the first world war from 1914 to 1918 and the indian soldiers did not die for india s cause india neither wanted to capture any country nor did it want to take away anyone s land but the indians had shown amazing strength very few people would know that about 74000 of our soldiers sacrificed their life in the first world war and this is also a matter of pride that about 9200 soldiers who lost their life were bestowed with gallantry award not only this there were eleven such individuals who received the highest honour of victoria cross about 4700 indians had sacrificed their life especially during the world war in march 2015 in france which has made a memorial as a mark of respect for them i went there to commemorate and express my gratitude to the strength displayed by our ancestors if we see all these incidents then we can say to the world that our country thinks in the direction of peace happiness and welfare of the world the country keeps doing something in this direction and if needed put its life at stake india finds itself in the first row among the highest contributors in the peacekeeping force of the united nation that is the matter of pride for us in the last few days i got the opportunity to accomplish two important tasks we are to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of respected babasaheb ambedkar there has been a controversy regarding the land where his memorial was to be built for many years i am satisfied that the government of india decided to allot the land for building the memorial of babasaheb ambedkar similarly there must be an international centre in the name of babasaheb ambedkar in delhi so that the entire world knows this sage his thoughts and his work this was also a matter which was pending for years i completed and laid the foundation stone of the memorial i pledged to complete the work in 20 months which did not happen for 20 years and at the same time a thought has also come into my mind and we are working on it even today there are many families in our country that are forced to carry dirt on their head is it a matter of grace for us that even today some families in our country have to carry the burden of dirt on their head with all earnest i said in the government forum to get us free from this blur in the year when we commemorating babasaheb ambedkar on his 125th birth anniversary now we will not tolerate a situation where any poor will have to take load of dirt on his head in our country for this we need the support of the society government must also shoulder its responsibility i need cooperation of people as we have to do this work babasaheb ambedkar used to say stay educated throughout life even today education has not reached many dalits exploited and deprived ones in the society especially girls we must also pledge on the occasion of 125th birth anniversary of babasaheb ambedkar there must not be any son or daughter of the poor remaining illiterate in our villages cities and locality government must do its duty and if it gets the support of the society then we will definitely feel a sense of satisfaction i want to share a matter of happiness and share another matter of discomfort as well i take pride of the fact that two daughters of india have made the country proud one daughter saina nehwal became the world s no 1 in badminton and the second daughter sania mirza became the world s top player in tennis doubles tournament congratulations to both and all the daughters of our country i feel proud seeing the effort and strength of our own but sometimes we lose cool when the cricket world cup was on and we lost to australia in the semi finals the kind of words used and the treatment meted out to the players was not good my countrymen how can be a game with no defeat victory and defeat are part and parcel of life if the players of our country have been beaten in a match then we must encourage them in the times of crisis there must be an effort to create an environment to generate new confidence i am sure that we will learn from the defeats going forward and we will not lose control in few moments by indulging in action reaction and i am getting worried whenever i see that anything happens all of a sudden a mob surrounds and burns the truck burns the vehicle and we see these things on tv as well accident must not happen even the government must make full effort but my dear countrymen tell me if we should burn the vehicles dead ones do not come back can t we ensure law to take its due course keeping our emotion in check well today my mind has been very grief stricken due to these incidents especially due to natural disasters but amidst this also we will move forward with courage and confidence be it individual of this country dalit oppressed exploited tribe villager poor farmer small businessman we will move forward on the path of welfare for everyone examinations of students are over especially the students of 10th and 12th standard must have made a program of celebrating the holidays i wish all of you a very good vacation get the opportunity to learn something new and since you have worked hard the whole year then i wish that you spend some time with your family with joy and happiness namaskar to everyone thank you ,namaskar i was not feeling like doing mann ki baat today i am feeling heavy and burdened and little distressed nepal is a dear to 125 crore people of india their grief is our grief i have seen kutch earthquake very closely on jan 26 2001
26-Apr-20,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on April 26, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged the overwhelming response and outpouring of suggestions from citizens during the COVID-19 lockdown. He emphasized that the fight against the pandemic in India is people-driven, with the entire nation coming together to battle the crisis, reflecting the spirit of altruism. The Prime Minister commended the efforts of healthcare professionals, police, sanitation workers, and other essential service providers who are on the frontline of the fight. He highlighted the importance of promoting hygiene, including wearing masks and refraining from spitting in public places. Prime Minister Modi also recognized India's role in supplying medicines to countries around the world, underscoring the nation's cultural ethos and the significance of Ayurveda and Yoga. The address touched upon the festival of Akshaya Tritiya, emphasizing the importance of charity and sustainability, and extended greetings to those celebrating Ramazan. It encouraged the nation to maintain vigilance and caution, even if their areas have not yet been affected by the virus, stressing the need to adhere to physical distancing. Prime Minister Modi concluded by wishing for a pandemic-free world by the next episode of Mann Ki Baat.",26-apr-2020 my dear countrymen namaskar all of you are tuned into this episode of mann ki baat during the lockdown the number of suggestions and phone calls for this episode is many times the usual matters close to your heart your own mann ki baat comprising a number of issues has reached out to me i ve tried to the best possible extent to read them listen to them one has come to know of certain aspects which do not get noticed during the course of this flurry of exigencies i wish to touch upon and share a few of those aspects with our countrymen in this mann ki baat taking place amidst a battle friends india s fight against corona is people driven in the truest sense of the term in india it is the people who are fighting the corona it is you who are putting up a fight along with the people the government and the administration are fighting as well a vast country such as india with its proactive endeavor on the path of development is fighting a decisive battle against poverty this is the only medium it possesses to fight the corona and triumph over it and we are fortunate that today the whole country each and every citizen of the country every person is a soldier in this battle nay leading the battle cast a glance anywhere you ll notice that india s fight is people driven at a time when the whole world is trying to extricate itself from the clutches of this pandemic in future when it will be dwelt upon in hindsight when ways and means will be reflected upon i do believe that india s people driven fight will also be touched upon today at each and every place in neighbourhood lanes people have come forward to help each other from food for the underprivileged arranging rations ensuring lockdown arrangements in hospitals to manufacturing medical equipments indigenously the entire country is marching ahead together in the same direction towards a single common objective collective applause thaalis lamps candles are reflective of a rising sentiment that has inspired countrymen to be altruistic motivating each and everyone on the way from metropolises to villages it comes across as a mahayagya being performed in the realm of our national ethos where every individual is eager to contribute a case in point are our farmer brothers and sisters on the one hand they are toiling day and night amidst the scourge of the pandemic on the other displaying due concern to ensure that none in the country goes to bed hungry everyone is putting up a fight as per one s capacity and ability there are some who are waiving off rent there are others depositing entire amounts received through prizes and pension in pm cares some are donating vegetables grown on farms others are feeding a multitude of the under privileged some are making masks at places our construction workers are whitewashing and painting schools meant for their quarantine stay friends the feeling that emanates from the core of your heart when you help others that touching benevolent emotion takes the form of inner strength in india s fight against corona making it people driven in every sense of the term and we have seen in recent years in our country this altruistic bent of mind is gaining strength it could be in the form of crores of people giving up gas subsidy lakhs of senior citizen leaving railway subsidy leading the swachcha bharat abhiyan or getting toilets constructed there are innumerable examples all these are reflective of the fact that we our minds and hearts have been intertwined along a common strong thread it has inspired us to do something for the country unitedly my dear countrymen with utmost humility and deepest respect i bow to this sentiment displayed by a 130 crore countrymen to facilitate your selfless endeavor towards our country as per your inclination and time the government has come up with a digital platform it is called covidwarriors gov in i repeat covidwarriors gov in through the medium of this platform the government has linked volunteers of social organizations representatives of civil society and local administration with each other it did not take long for 1 25 crore people to be part of this portal they comprise doctors nurses asha anm workers our friends from ncc and nss professionals from myriad fields all of them have made the platform their own these people are of immense help at the local level in preparing crisis management plans and implementing them you too can join covidwarriors gov in to be a covid warrior and serve the country friends every adverse situation every battle leaves in its wake a worthwhile lesson or two a moral it paves the way for further possibilities shaping the course for newer goals the strength of the resolve the countrymen have displayed during the crisis has led to the beginning of a new transformation too in india our businesses offices educational institutions our medical sector are rapidly advancing towards new operational changes on the technology front it actually seems every innovator in the country is coming up anew with something or the other amid emerging situations we are experiencing the results of the entire country in unison as a team today the central government state governments each and every department and institution are working hand in hand for relief at full speed people working in the aviation sector railway employees are working day and night to alleviate hurdles confronting our countrymen many of you might be aware of a special campaign called lifeline udan undertaken for ensuring supply of medicines to every corner of the country within a short span of time our colleagues clocked a flight distance of three lakh kilometers delivering over five hundred tons of medical supplies to you in the farthest corners of the country similarly our colleagues in the railways are working relentlessly during the lockdown so that the common man throughout the country does not have to face the shortage of essential commodities for this indian railways is running more than 100 parcel trains on close to 60 routes similarly our postal department personnel are playing a critical role in ensuring medical supplies all these colleagues of ours are corona warriors in the truest sense friends money is being directly transferred into the accounts of the poor as part of the pradhan mantri gareeb kalyan package old age pension has been started the poor are being provided facilities like free of cost gas cylinders and rations for three months in all these activities different government departments and banking sector personnel are working together round the clock as a team and i would also like to commend our state governments for playing a very proactive role in dealing with this pandemic the responsibilities being borne by local administrations and state governments are critical in the fight against corona their hard work is worthy of commendation my dear countrymen medical services personnel across the country have expressed satisfaction with the ordinance that has been issued recently this ordinance provides for stringent punishment for those harassing or injuring or indulging in violence against corona warriors this step was critical to ensure the safety of our doctors nurses para medical staff community health workers and all such personnel who are working round the clock to ensure a corona free india my dear countrymen we feel that during the fight against this pandemic we have been accorded an opportunity to look at our lives our society and the happenings around us with a fresh perspective there is a far reaching change in the viewpoint of the society today we realise the importance of each person who is connected with our lives whether they are household helps common workers who fulfill our various needs or personnel working in shops nearby we are realising what a major role they play in our lives similarly personnel delivering essential services labourers working in marketplaces the auto rickshaw drivers in our neighbourhood today we realise how difficult our lives can be without them these days we regularly see on the social media that during the lock down people are not only remembering these colleagues and helping them with their needs but are also writing about them with great respect today we see pictures coming in from all corners where sanitation workers are being showered with petals earlier you probably did not even notice their contribution doctors cleaning staff and other such services personnel and even our police organisations are being seen in a new light by the common people earlier when we thought of the police we were engulfed only by negative thoughts today our police personnel are ensuring that food and medicines reach the poor and the needy just as the police is stepping forward to help a humane and sensitive aspect of policing has manifested itself before us and has touched our hearts to the very core this is a time when common folk are connecting with the police at an emotional level our police personnel are treating this as an opportunity for serving the public and i am fully confident that such incidents can in the times to come bring about a very positive change and we must never tar this positivity with hues of negativity friends we often hear three words nature perversion and culture if you see these words together and see the intent behind these words you will find a new key to understanding life if we talk of human nature this is mine i am using this such a mindset is considered quite natural nobody seems to have any objection to this we can refer to this as nature but that which doesn t belong to me which is not rightfully mine and i forcibly snatch it from another person and use can be referred to as a kind of perversion or degeneration beyond these two i e nature and perversion if a cultured mind rises above in thought and action then culture manifests itself when something that is rightfully yours something that you earned through hard work something that is essential for you be it little or more without bothering about such things you are willing to see the other person s need to look beyond your self interest and willing to share what is rightfully yours with another person that reflects culture friends in critical times these qualities are put to the test you would have seen in the past few days that india has taken some decisions while keeping true to its culture and ethos and upholding our cultural heritage during this crisis the world including rich and prosperous nations is facing a shortage of medicines in these times even if india does not provide medicines to the world no one would have faulted us every country would understand that obviously india would prioritise the lives of its own citizens but friends india went beyond nature and degeneration and took a decision we took a decision in keeping with our culture while we stepped up efforts to fulfill india s needs we also paid heed to the cry of help that came from other parts of the world to save humanity we undertook the task of providing medical supplies to the needy across the world and have successfully completed this humanitarian task today when i speak to heads of state of various countries on phone they make sure to express gratitude to the people of india when they say thank you india thank you people of india we feel greater pride in our country in the same vein people across the world are paying special attention to the importance of india s ayurveda and yoga just look at the social media how people everywhere are discussing india s ayurveda and yoga to boost immunity i am sure you all are following the corona related protocol to boost immunity suggested by the ayush ministry warm water decoction and other guidelines issued by ayush ministry would be very helpful for you if you include it in your daily routine friends it has been our misfortune that we always refuse to acknowledge our own strengths and glorious traditions but when another country of the world says the very same thing on the basis of evidence based research when they teach us our own formula we instantly accept their assertions possibly this is largely due to our hundreds of year long phase of bondage due to this often we fail to realise our own strengths our self confidence wavers that s why instead of presenting our traditional principles with evidence based research we just ignore them and consider them inferior india s young generation will now have to take up this challenge just as the world has happily accepted yoga the world will surely also accept our ages old ayurvedic principles of course the youth will have to resolve to do this and explain these principles to the world in a scientific language so that they understand it friends i must say many positive changes are organically making their way into our work culture our lifestyle and our daily habits you all must have felt how this crisis has made us more aware and heightened our consciousness on various subjects the effect that is most visible around us is wearing a mask and covering the face in the changed paradigm due to corona masks are becoming a part of our lives we were never used to seeing so many people around us in masks but we are now getting used to that reality however it does not mean that all those wearing a mask are sick and when i talk of masks i am reminded of something you might also remember this there was a time when in many parts of our country if we saw someone buying fruits in our neighbourhood we would enquire about their health so buying fruits meant illness that was the notion back then but times have changed and this paradigm too has shifted similarly we are going to see a change in attitude towards masks as well mark my words masks will now become a symbol of cultured society if you want to save yourself and others from disease you will have to wear a mask and my simple suggestion to every one is to use a gumchha or a light towel to cover the face friends another awareness that has come about in our society is that people now understand the damage that can be caused by spitting in public places it had been a part of our bad habits that we would spit just about anywhere this presents a serious challenge both to cleanliness and to health although if we look at it we have always been aware of this problem but this problem just refused to get addressed by our society but it s time now to get rid of this problem once and for all as they say better late than never so even though we have been late in addressing it but now we must eradicate the spitting habit these things will not only boost our basic hygiene levels but also help in preventing the spread of the corona infection my dear countrymen it is a happy coincidence that today when i am sharing my mann ki baat with you it also happens to be the holy festival of akshaya tritiya friends kshay in hindi means destruction but akshay means that which is indestructible or which never ends or is forever we all celebrate this festival every year in our homes but this year it bears a special significance for us in the present troubled times this is a day that reminds us that our soul our life force is akshay this day reminds us that no matter how many difficulties block our path no matter how many disasters are wreaked upon us and no matter how many contagions have to be faced the human spirit of fighting and battling them are inexhaustible it is also believed that this is the day when the pandavas got the akshaya patra through the blessings of lord krishna and lord suryadev akshaya patra was the mythical vessel which always remained replete with food our farmers are our annadata or providers who work hard in adverse conditions for the country for all of us imbued with this spirit it is due to their hard work that today the country has vast reserves of food grains for all of us and for the poor on this day of akshaya tritiya we should give a thought about the preservation of our environment forests rivers and the entire ecosystem which play an important role in our lives if we want to remain bestowed with renewable resources then we must first ensure that our earth remains ever abundant did you know that this festival of akshaya tritiya also provides us an occasion to realize the strength of charity power of giving whatever we give away wholeheartedly is what actually matters it is not important what and how much we give in this period of crisis our small efforts can become a huge support for many people around us friends this is a very holy day in jain traditions as it happens to be an important day in the life of the first tirthankara lord rishabhdev the followers of jainism celebrate it as a festival and hence it is quite easy to understand why on this day people like to initiate an auspicious project since today is the day to initiate something anew cannot we all take a resolve to make our earth bountiful and imperishable through our efforts friends today also marks the birth anniversary of lord basaveshwara it has been my good fortune that i have had the opportunity to learn and connect with reminiscences of lord basaveshwara and his messages repeatedly i extend many felicitations to all the followers of lord basaveshwara in our country and the world on his birth anniversary friends the holy month of ramazan too has begun the last time when ramazan was celebrated no one had imagined that we would be facing such a huge predicament this time around but now that this trouble has come to plague the entire world it gives us an opportunity to mark this ramazan as an icon of restraint goodwill sensitivity and service this time we should pray more than ever before so that prior to the celebration of eid the world is rid of corona and we celebrate eid with enthusiasm and gaiety like earlier times i am confident that during these days of ramazan by adhering to the guidelines of the local administration we will reinforce our fight against corona it is still very important to follow the rules of physical distancing in the streets in the markets and in the mohallas or colonies today i also express my gratitude to all those community leaders who are making people aware about the two yards distancing and not going out of the houses in fact corona has changed the manner of celebrating festivals all over the world including india it has changed the ways of their observance recently we observed many festivals such as bihu baisakhi puthandu vishu and odia new year we saw how people celebrated these festivals staying indoors with great simplicity while wishing well for society in ordinary circumstances they used to celebrate these festivals with full zeal and enthusiasm with friends and families people used to come out of the house and share joy but this time everyone observed restraint following the rules of lockdown we have seen that this time our christian brethren too celebrated easter within the confines of their homes it is imperative at present to fulfill this responsibility of ours towards society and our nation only then will we be able to prevent the spread of corona we will be able to defeat a pandemic like corona my dear countrymen in the midst of this pandemic as a member of your family and all of you happen to be my family members it is also my responsibility to touch upon certain points and offer some suggestions to my countrymen i urge let us not at all get caught in the trap of over confidence let us not harbor a feeling that if corona has not yet reached our city our village our street or our office it is not going to reach now see never make such a mistake the experience of the world is narrating a lot to us and here in our country we are always reminded again and again where caution has been lowered the accident has happened remember our ancestors have guided us very well in dealing with such situations our ancestors have said agni shesham rina shesham vyadhi sheshamtathaivacha punah punah pravardheta tasmaat shesham na kaaryet that is fire debt and illness if taken lightly grow again at the first opportunity assuming dangerous proportions so it is important to treat them completely therefore in over enthusiasm there should be no negligence at the local level or elsewhere we will always have to remain cautious and i will reiterate maintain a distance of two yards and keep yourself healthy or do gaz doori bahut hai zaroori wishing all of you the best of health i conclude my thoughts i also wish that when we meet during the next episode of mann ki baat may some news of escape from the clutches of this pandemic and mankind emerging out of this predicament greet us from all over the world thank you very much here is mannkibaat april 2020 today s mannkibaat takes place when we are in the midst of a yuddh india s fight against covid 19 is people driven every indian is a soldier in this fight look

26-Aug-18,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on August 26, 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended warm greetings to the nation on the occasion of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami, emphasizing the significance of these festivals in promoting social harmony. He also spoke about the rich heritage and versatility of the Sanskrit language, highlighting its importance in various fields, including science, technology, agriculture, and more. The Prime Minister praised the culture of Guru Shishya and the importance of teachers in society, paying tribute to former President Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan. He expressed his concern and condolences for the flood-affected regions, particularly Kerala, and commended the armed forces and NDRF for their relentless efforts in rescue and relief operations. Modi highlighted the positive achievements of the Monsoon session of Parliament and various bills passed for social justice, women's safety, and more. He applauded Indian athletes participating in the Asian Games and stressed the importance of sports for a healthy and developed India. The Prime Minister also acknowledged the remarkable architectural and engineering marvels in India, particularly the Kailashnath Temple, Brihdeshwar Temple, and Rani Ki Vaav, honoring the contributions of engineers like Dr. M. Visvesvaraya. He called for discussions on disaster management and sustainable construction as part of the observance of Engineers Day. Narendra Modi concluded with festive greetings for the upcoming Diwali and the promise of continued efforts to take the nation forward.",26-aug-2018 my dear countrymen namaskar today the entire country is celebrating rakshabandhan heartiest greetings to all fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion the festival of rakshabandhan symbolizes the bond of love trust between a brother a sister for centuries this festival has proved to be a shining example of social harmony in the nation s history there are innumerable accounts of this sacred thread binding together people of distant lands different religions around a spindle of trust in a few days from now we shall celebrate the festive occasion of janmashtami the whole atmosphere will reverberate to the sonorous chants calls of hathi ghoda palki jai kanhaiyalalki and govinda govinda it is indeed an extremely joyous experience to imbue the essence of bhagwan krishna revel blissfully in other parts of the country especially maharashtra our young friends must be busy with preparations of the dahi handi the festive ritual of the human pyramid breaking the curd filled earthen pot heartiest greetings to all countrymen on the festive occasions of rakshabandhanand janmashtami bhaginichinmayee sister chinmayee has asked a question in sanskrit excellent extraordinary my salutations to you on the occasion of sanskrit week i extend my best wishes to all countrymen i am extremely thankful to young chinmayee for touching upon this subject friends apart from rakshabandhan shravanpoornima is also celebrated as sanskrit day i congratulate all those actively involved in preserving conserving this glorious heritage helping it to reach out to the masses every language has its own significance sanctity india takes great pride in the fact that tamil is the most ancient of world languages we indians also feel proud that from vedic times to the modern day sanskrit language has played a stellar role in the universal spread of knowledge sanskrit language literature encompasses a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to every facet of life science technology agriculture health mathematics management economy environment the entire spectrum has been touched upon it is said that our vedas have detailed reference on mantras onways means to counter the challenges of global warming you will be pleased to know that even today residents of village mattur in shivamoga district of karnataka use sanskrit as their lingua franca you will be astonished to know that sanskrit is a language that possesses the capacity for infinite word formation with two thousand verb roots 200 suffixes 22 prefixes coupled with compounds the possibility of word creation is limitless and that is why the minutest nuance of an expression or subject can be accurately described this has been the core speciality of sanskrit today at times in order to communicate more assertively we tend to make use of english quotations or even sher o shayari urdu poetry but those who are well acquainted with sanskrit subhashitas epigrammatic verses know very well that it is possible to make a crisp precise statement using very few words through the usage of subhashitas and since there is a sense of geographical cultural belonging they are easy to understand assimilate for example in order to illustrate the significance of the guru in one s life it has been said thereby meaning when a guru imparts even an iota of knowledge to the student there is no material or wealth on the entire earth that the student can make use of to repay the guru we must abide by the same essence the same spirit as we celebrate teachers day knowledge the guru are incomparable invaluable priceless on the occasion of teachers day we remember the great philosopher former president of india dr sarvapalliradhakrishnanji his birth anniversary is celebrated as teacher day across the country i felicitate all the teachers in the country on this occasion i also salute your sense of commitment towards science education and students my dear countrymen the monsoon comes along bringing a new ray of hope to our toiling farmers it provided much needed succor to the scorched trees shrubs and to parched water bodies on the other hand excessive rainfall causes devastating floods it s a vagary of nature that some places have received higher rainfall compared to other places we just saw how the terrible floods in kerala have affected human lives in today s pressing hard times the entire nation is with kerala our sympathies are with those families who lost their loved ones loss of lives cannot be compensated but i assure the grief stricken families that in this moment of suffering misery a hundred twenty five crore indians stand by them shoulder to shoulder i earnestly pray for those injured in this natural disaster to get well soon i firmly believe that the sheer grit and courage of the people of the state will see kerala rise again disasters unfortunately leave behind a trail of destruction but one gets to witness facets of humanity humaneness during disasters from kutch to kamrup from kashmir to kanyakumari everyone is endeavoring to contribute in some way or the other so that wherever a disaster strikes be it kerala or any other part of india human life returns to normalcy irrespective of age group or area of work people are contributing everyone is trying to ensure speedy mitigation of the sufferings people in kerala are going through in fact sharing their pain we know that jawans of our armed forces are the vanguards of rescue relief operations in kerala they have left no stone unturned as saviors of those trapped in the floods the air force navy army bsf cisf raf every agency has played an exemplary role in the rescue relief operations i would like to specially mention the arduous endeavors of the ndrf daredevils at this moment of hardship agony their service stands out as a shining example the capability commitment controlling situation through rapid decisions of the ndrf have made them a cynosure of every indian s eye worthy of respect admiration yesterday was the festival of onam we pray for onam to provide strength to the country especially kerala so that it returns to normalcy on a newer journey of development once again on behalf of all indians i would like to re assure each everyone in kerala and other affected places that at this moment of calamity the entire country stands by them my dear countrymen i was looking into the suggestions received for mann ki baat the subject about which most of the people from across the country have written is our revered atalbehari vajpayee kirti from ghaziabad swati vats from sonepat brother praveen from kerala dr swapan banerjee from west bengal akhilesh pandey from katihar bihar and numerous others have written on narendra modi mobile app and mygov asking me to speak on various aspects of atalji s life as soon as the people in our country and abroad heard of the demise of atalji on 16th august everyone drowned in sadness he was a leader who gave up his position as prime minister fourteen years ago in a way he was cut off from active politics for the last 10 years he was neither seen in the news nor in public life ten years is a huge gap but on 16th august our country and the whole world witnessed that there was not a gap of even a single moment in the commonman s heart the wave of love and faith that spread across the nation is an indicator of his great personality during these last days many great aspects of atalji came up to the fore people remembered him as the best member of parliament sensitive writer best orator and most popular prime minister and will continue to remember him the country will ever remain grateful to atalji for bringing good governance in the main stream but i just want to touch upon one more facet of atalji s legendary personality and that is the political culture which atalji gave to india his efforts in the direction of bringing about the changes in our political culture his efforts to mould it into an organized framework and which proved very beneficial for india and a bigger benefit will accrue in days to come this is certain india will remain ever grateful to atalji for bringing the 91st amendment act 2003 this change brought about two important changes in india s politics first one is that the size of the cabinet in states was restricted to 15 of the total seats in the state assembly and the second one is that the limit under the anti defection law was enhanced from one thirds to two thirds besides clear guidelines were defined to disqualify the defector for many years in india the political culture of forming a very large cabinet was being misused to constitute jumbo cabinets not only to create a divide but also to appease political leaders atalji changed it this effort of his resulted in saving of money as well as of resources this also helped in improving efficiency it could only be a visionary like atalji who brought in this transformation and as a result of this healthy traditions blossomed in our polity atalji was a true patriot it was during his tenure that the timing of presenting the budget was changed earlier as was the british tradition the budget used to be presented at 5 pm because in london parliament used to start working at that time in the year 2001 atalji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am one more freedom the indian flag code was framed in atalji s tenure and it came into effect in 2002 a number of such rules have been included in this code which made it possible to unfurl the tricolor in public places this provided a chance to more and more of our countrymen to unfurl our national flag thus he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the commonman you must have noticed how atalji took bold steps to bring about fundamental reforms whether in our election process or about the shortcomings concerning the people s representatives similarly you can see that presently efforts are afoot and discussions are being held about simultaneously holding the elections for lok sabha and for state assemblies the government and the opposition both are putting forth their view points this is a good development and a healthy sign for our democracy i must say that developing healthy traditions for a sound democracy making constant efforts to strengthen democracy encouraging open minded debates would also be aappropriate tribute to atalji reiterating our resolve to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed india i along with all of you pay tributes to atalji my dear countrymen whenever a discussion about parliament is there nowadays it is about hold ups noisy scenes and stalling the proceedings but when something good happens it is not given much importance the monsoon session of parliament ended just a few days back you will be glad to know that the productivity of lok sabha remained 118 percent and that of rajya sabha was 74 percent all the members rose above party interests to make the monsoon session most productive and this is why lok sabha passed 21 bills and in rajya sabha fourteen bills were passed this monsoon session of parliament will always be remembered as a session for social justice and youth welfare a number of importantbills beneficial to the youth and the backward classes were passed during this session as you know a demand to constitute an obc commission similar to sc st commission was long pending for decades the country fulfilled its resolve this time to make an obc commission and also granted it constitutional powers this step will prove to be the one to move forward our march towards achieving the goal of social justice an amendment bill to secure the rights of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes also were passed in this session this act will give more security to the interests of sc and st communities this will also forbid criminals from indulging in atrocities and will instill confidence among the dalit communities no civil society can tolerate any kind of injustice towards the woman power of the country the nation will not tolerate those committing rapes with this point in view parliament has made a provision of strictest punishment by passing the criminal act amendment bill those guilty of rape will get a minimum sentence of ten years and those found guilty of raping girls below the age of 12 years will be awarded the death sentence recently you might have read in newspapers that a court in mandsaur in madhya pradesh after a brief hearing of two months pronounced the death sentence on two criminals found guilty of raping a minor girl earlier a court in katni in madhya pradesh awarded the death sentence to the guilty after a hearing of just five days courts in rajasthan have also taken similar quick decisions this act will play an effective role in curbing crimes against women and girls economic growth will be incomplete without a social transformation the triple talaq bill has been passed by the lok sabha although it could not be passed in the rajya sabha i assure the muslim women that the whole country stands by them to provide them social justice when we move ahead in the national interest a change in the lives of the poor the backward the exploited and the deprived ones can also be brought about in the monsoon session this time everyone jointly presented an ideal approach today i publicly express my heartfelt gratitude to all mp s my dear countrymen the attention of crores of indians is focused on the asian games being held in jakarta every morning first of all people look for newspapers television news and social media to check indian playerswinning medals the asian games are going on i wish to congratulate all players who have won medals for the country i extend my best wishes to thoseplayers who are yet to compete indian players are performing exceedingly well in shooting and wrestling but our players are winning medals in those competitions too in which our performance has not been so good earlier like wushu and rowing these are not just medals but an evidence of the sky high spirits of the indian players among those winning medals for our country are a large number of our daughters which is a very positive sign so much so that youngsters of only 15 16 years of age have brought honour to our country by winning medals this too is a very positive indication that most of the medal winners hail from small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success by putting in sheer hard work we shall celebrate national sports day on 29th august and i extend my best wishes to all sport lovers and also pay my tributes to the legendary hockey wizard shri dhyanchandji i request every citizen to make it a point to play and take care of their fitness because only a healthy india will build a developed and prosperous india when india will be fit only then india s future will be bright once again i congratulate the medal winners at the asian games and also wish the remaining players perform well many good wishes to you all on the national sports day namaste bhawnaji i respect your sentiments all of us have seen houses and buildings being constructed of bricks and stones but can you imagine that about twelve hundred years ago a giant mountain which was a single stone mountain was give the shape of an elegant huge and a unique temple this may be difficult to imagine but this happened and that temple is kailashnathmandir in ellora mahrashtra would you believe if someone tells you that about a thousand years ago an over sixty metrestall pillar of granite was built and anothergranite rock weighing about 80 tonnes was placed over its top but brihdeshwar temple of thanjavur in tamil nadu is the place where this unbelievable combination of engineering and architecture can be seen anybody will feel overawed on seeing rani ki vaav of the 11th century in patan in gujarat our land has been an engineering laboratory there have been several engineers in india who made the unimaginable possible and presented such marvels of engineering before the world in this lineage of great engineers we were blessed with a diamond whose work is still a source of wonder for all he was bharat ratna dr m visvesvaraya lakhs of farmers and common people continue to benefit from the krishna raj sagar dam built by him he is greatly revered in that part of our country and the whole nation remembers him with great respect and regard in his memory 15th september is observed as engineers day following his footsteps our engineers have created their own identity in the world when i talk of wonders in the engineering world i am reminded of an incident of 2001 when a devastating earth quake hit kutch in gujarat i used to work as avolunteer there during those days i got a chance to go to a village and had a chance to meet a lady of more than a hundred years of age and she was looking at me and mockingly saying look at my house it is called bhoonga in kutch this house has faced three earthquakes i myself have seen three in this house itself but you did not find any damage anywhere these houses were built by our ancestors in sync with nature and surroundings of this place and she was saying all this with such a feeling of pride that it made me think that engineers in that era had constructed such structures according to the local situations which kept the commonman safe and secured while observing engineers day we should think of the future as well workshops should be held at different places what are the things we need to learn in the changing times what do we need to teach what do we need to connect to nowadays disaster management has assumed immense significance the world is facing natural calamities what then should be the new form of structural engineering what courses should be designed to that end what should be taught to the students how do we keep construction eco friendly how can we enhance the quality of construction by making value addition through local materials how do we make zero waste our priority all such points need to be pondered upon when we observe engineers day my dear countrymen there is a mood of festivity and with this the preparations for diwali also begin we will keep meeting through mann ki baat and will keep sharing matters close to our hearts we will join hands in taking our country forward with heartfelt vigor with these feelings i extend my best wishes to

every person every organization takes a resolution to do something better to become better in the coming year for the last seven years our mann ki baat has also been inspiring us to do better and improve further by highlighting the goodness of the individual of the society of the country in these seven years while doing mann ki baat i could also have discussed the achievements of the government you too would have liked it you would have appreciated it as well but it is my experience of decades that away from the glare of the media away from the headlines of newspapers there are millions of people who are doing great things they are expending their today for the ensuing tomorrow of the country for the coming generations of the country they are busy today relentlessly with their efforts talking about such people is very comforting gives deep inspiration for me mann ki baat has always been a beautiful garden filled with the efforts of such people and in mann ki baat every month my effort is from this garden which petal should i pluck for you i am happy that from the treasure trove of our land the unceasing flow of virtuous deeds keeps on flowing ceaselessly and today when the country is celebrating amrit mahotsav the mention of this janashakti the strength of each and every individual their efforts their hard work in a way guarantees a bright future for india and humanity friends this is the strength of the people it is because of everyone s effort that india could fight the biggest pandemic in a 100 years we stood by each other like a family in every difficult moment to help someone in one s locality or city everyone tried to do more than what one could have done if we compare the vaccination figures of the world today with those of india it feels that the country has handled such an unprecedented task how big a goal has been achieved crossing the 140 million vaccine dose mark is an achievement of each and every indian this shows the trust of every indian in the system shows trust in science and in scientists and is also a testament to the willpower of we indians who are fulfilling our responsibilities towards the society but friends we also have to keep in mind that a new variant of corona has already knocked at the door our experience of the last two years is that our own effort as a citizen is very important to defeat this global pandemic our scientists are continuously studying this new omicron variant they are getting new data everyday their suggestions are being worked upon in such a situation self awareness self discipline is in itself the country s strength in fighting against this variant of corona it is this very collective strength of ours that will defeat corona with this very sense of responsibility we have to enter into 2022 my dear countrymen during the battle of mahabharata bhagwan shri krishna expressed to arjuna nabhah sprisham deeptam i e touch the sky with pride this is also the motto of the indian air force many lives engaged in the service of maa bharati soar over these heights of the sky with pride every day they teach us a lot such was the life of group captain varun singh varun singh was flying the helicopter that fell prey to a mishap this month in tamil nadu in that accident we lost the country s first cds general bipin rawat and his wife along with many brave hearts varun singh also fought death bravely for many days but then he also left us when varun was in the hospital i saw something on social media that touched my heart he was given shaurya chakra in august just this year after this honor he had written a letter to the principal of his school after reading this letter the first thought that came to my mind was that even after reaching the pinnacle of success he did not forget to nurture his roots second that when he had time to celebrate he showed concern for the generations to come he wanted that the lives of the students of the school that he studied in should also be a celebration in his letter varun singh ji did not boast of his valour instead he referred to his failures he talked about how he converted his shortcomings into abilities at one place in this letter he has written it is ok to be mediocre not everyone will excel at school and not everyone will be able to score in the 90s if you do it is an amazing achievement and must be applauded however if you don t do not think that you are meant to be mediocre you may be mediocre in school but it is by no means a measure of things to come in life find your calling it could be art music graphic design literature etc whatever you work towards be dedicated do your best never go to bed thinking i could have put in more efforts friends the mantra he has given to rise from average to extraordinary is equally important in this letter varun singh has written never lose hope never think that you cannot be good at what you want to be it will not come easy it will take sacrifice of time and comfort i was mediocre and today i have reached difficult milestones in my career do not think that 12th board marks decide what you are capable of achieving in life believe in yourself and work towards it varun had written that if he could inspire even a single student it would be a lot but today i would like to say he has inspired the whole country even though his letter talks only to the students he has given a message to our entire society every year i discuss such similar topics with students on exams this year also i am planning to discuss with the students before the exams the registration for this program is also going to start two days later 28th december onwards on mygov in this registration will be on from 28th december to 20th january for this online competition will

countries closer my greetings to these students of greece and their teachers i appreciate their effort during the azadi ka amrit mahotsav friends i would also like to discuss a post of nilesh ji a resident of lucknow nilesh ji has showered praises on a unique drone show in lucknow this drone show was organized in the residency area of lucknow the testimony of the first freedom struggle of 1857 is still visible on the walls of the residency in the drone show held at the residency different aspects of the indian freedom struggle were brought to life be it chauri chaura andolan the kakori train incident or netaji subhash s indomitable courage and valor this drone show won everyone s hearts similarly you can also bring to the people the unique aspects related to the freedom movement connected to your cities villages in that you can take a lot of help of technology azadi ka amrit mahotsav gives us an opportunity to live the memories of the freedom struggle gives us an opportunity to experience them this is an inspiring festival a motivating occasion to display the will to do something to take new resolves for the country let us continue to be inspired by the great personalities of the freedom struggle continue to further strengthen our efforts for the country my dear countrymen our india is endowed with many extraordinary talents whose work inspires others to do something one such person is dr kurela vithalacharya ji from telangana he is 84 years old vithalacharya ji exemplifies the fact that when it comes to fulfilling your dreams age does not matter at all friends right from childhood vitthlacharya ji had a wish to open a big library the country was a slave then some circumstances were such that the childhood dream remained just a dream over time vittlachary ji became a lecturer deeply studied the telugu language and also created many works in the same 6 7 years ago he once again started fulfilling his dream he started a library with his own books he put his life s earnings into this gradually people started joining and contributing to it in this library at ramannapet division in yadadri bhuvnagiri district there are nearly 2 lakh books vitthalacharya ji says that when it comes to studies none else should have to face the difficulties he had to today he feels very happy to see that a large number of students are getting its benefits inspired by his efforts people of many other villages have started setting up libraries friends books not only impart knowledge they also shape personality and life the hobby of reading books leads to a wonderful satisfaction these days i notice people proudly saying that they have read these many books this year and that i want to read many more of such books this is a good trend which should be enhanced further i would also ask the listeners of mann ki baat to mention about five books of theirs this year which have been their favourites in this way you will also be able to help other readers to choose good books in 2022 at a time when the screen time is on the upswing book reading should get more and more popular for that too we will have to strive together my dear countrymen recently my attention has been drawn to an interesting endeavor this effort is to make our ancient texts and cultural values popular not only in india but all over the world in pune there is a centre named bhandarkar oriental research institute this institute has started an online course to acquaint the people of other countries with the importance of mahabharata you would be amazed to know that although this this course has been started now the content being taught started taking shape over a 100 years ago when the institute started a course with regard to this it received tremendous response i am discussing this grand initiative so that people become aware of how the various aspects of our traditions are being presented in a modern manner innovative methods are also being adopted to ensure its benefits reach people based across seven seas friends today there is a growing interest in the world to know about indian culture people from different countries are not only curious to know about our culture but are also helping to spread it one such person is serbian scholar dr momir nikich he has compiled a bilingual sanskrit serbian dictionary more than 70 thousand sanskrit words included in this dictionary have been translated into serbian language you would be delighted to know that dr nikich has learned sanskrit language at the age of 70 he tells that he got his inspiration from reading the articles of mahatma gandhi a similar example is that of 93 ninety three year old professor j gendedharam of mongolia in the last 4 decades he has translated about 40 ancient texts epics and compositions of india into mongolian language many people are working with this kind of passion in our country too i also got to know about the efforts of sagar mule ji of goa who is involved in saving centuries old kaavi painting from extinction kaavi form of painting covers the ancient history of india in itself actually kaava means red soil in ancient times red clay was used in this art during the portuguese rule in goa the people who migrated from there introduced the people of other states to this wonderful painting form with the passage of time this painting was on the verge of extinction but sagar mule ji has infused a new lease of life to this art his efforts are also getting a lot of appreciation friends a small effort even a small step can make a huge contribution in the preservation of our rich arts if the people of our country are determined the passion to adorn beautify and save our ancient arts across the country can take the form of a mass movement i ve talked about a few attempts here many such efforts are taking place across the country do convey information on them to me through namo app my dear countrymen the people of arunachal pradesh have been running a unique campaign for a year and have named it arunachal pradesh airgun surrender campaign in this campaign people are voluntarily surrendering their airguns do you know why so that indiscriminate hunting of birds can be stopped in arunachal pradesh friends arunachal pradesh is home to more than 500 species of birds these include some indigenous species which are not found anywhere else in the world but gradually now the number of birds in the forests has started declining this airgun surrender campaign is going on now to rectify this very situation during the past few months from the hills to the plains from one community to the other people everywhere in the state welcomed it with open arms the people of arunachal have voluntarily surrendered more than 1600 airguns i commend and congratulate the people of arunachal for this my dear countrymen there have been many messages and suggestions related to 2022 from all of you one theme is always there in most people s messages that is of cleanliness and swachh bharat this resolve of cleanliness will be fulfilled only with discipline awareness and dedication we can get a glimpse of that in the puneet sagar campaign undertaken by cadets more than 30 thousand ncc cadets participated in this campaign these cadets cleaned the beaches removed plastic waste from there and collected it for recycling our beaches our mountains are worth visiting only when there is cleanliness at the place many people dream of going to a particular place all their lives but when they go there knowingly or unknowingly they leave behind waste there it is the responsibility of every countryman that the places which give us so much joy should not be dirtied by us friends i have come to know about a start up named saafwater which has been started by some youth with the help of artificial intelligence and internet of things it will give information related to the purity and quality of water in their area to people this is just the next step of cleanliness in view of the importance of this start up for the clean and healthy future of the people it has also received a global award friends in this effort ek qadam swachhata ki ore be it the institutions or the government everyone has an important role you all know that earlier there used to be a lot of old files and papers in government offices ever since the government has started changing the old practices these files and piles of paper are getting digitized and stored in computer folders special campaigns are also being run in ministries and departments to remove the old and pending material some very interesting things have happened through this campaign when this cleanliness drive was started in the department of post the junkyard there became completely empty now this junkyard has been turned into a courtyard and cafeteria another junkyard has been converted into a parking space for two wheelers similarly the ministry of environment converted its vacant junkyard into a wellness centre the ministry of urban affairs has even installed a swachh atm too its purpose is that people deposit garbage and take cash in return departments under the civil aviation ministry have started making organic compost from dry leaves falling from trees and organic waste this department is also working to make stationery from waste paper our government departments can also be so innovative on a subject like cleanliness till a few years ago no one even believed in it but today it is becoming a part of the system this is the new thinking of the country which is being led by all the countrymen together my dear countrymen this time also in mann ki baat we touched upon many topics like every time after a month we will meet again but in 2022 every new beginning also brings an opportunity to recognize your potential goals we didn t even imagine before today the country is making efforts for them it is said here kshanashah kanashashchaiva vidyam artham cha saadhayet kshane nashte kuto vidya kane nashte kuto dhanam that is when we want to earn knowledge learn something new or do it we should make use of every single moment and when we have to earn money that is progress and growth every particle every resource should be used optimally since with the destruction of the moment learning and knowledge are gone and with the destruction of the particle the resource paths to wealth and progress are closed this thing is an inspiration for all of us countrymen we have to learn so much innovate anew achieve new goals therefore we will have to persevere without wasting even a moment we have to take the country to new heights of development so we have to make full use of every resource of ours in a way this is also the mantra of atma nirbhar bharat that is self reliant india because when we use our resources properly we will not let them go waste only then will we recognize the power of local only then will the country be self reliant so let us reiterate our resolve to think big dream big and work hard to make them come true and our dreams will not be limited to us alone our dreams will be such that the development of our society and the country is connected our progress will open the way for the progress of the country and for this we have to start working from today without wasting a single moment without losing a single particle or resource i am fully confident that with this very resolve the country will move forward in the coming year and 2022 will be the golden page of building a new india with this very faith wishing you all a very happy 2022 thank you very much sharing this month s mannkibaat for me mannkibaat is not about highlighting the work of the government which could have been easily done instead it is about collective efforts by grassroots level change makers says pm narendramodi mannkibaat india is fighting covid 19 thanks to the spirited effort by our jan shakti mannkibaat india s

help others make their reading list for 2022 mannkibaat in an era where screen time is increasing let us also make reading books popular mannkibaat it is our duty to preserve and popularise our culture it is equally gladdening to see global efforts that celebrate indian culture mannkibaat a commendable effort to preserve goa s unique cultural heritage mannkibaat here is why the prime minister applauded the people of arunachal pradesh during mannkibaat as usual india is filled with innovative efforts to further swachhata mannkibaat there is a massive swachhata abhiyaan even in the highest levels of government here are some innovative efforts by the department of posts mohua india moefcc and moca goi mannkibaat the next mannkibaat will take place in the year 2022 let us keep

of phalgun and are eagerly awaiting to welcome the arrival of the new month of chaitra the ritu of vasant that is the season of spring is indeed the confluence of these two months at the outset i express my gratitude to lakhs of citizens of our country for sending in a multitude of suggestions when i ask for them before mann ki baat on the narendramodiapp on twitter on facebook by post i thank all of you for that shobha jalan has written to me on the narendramodiapp that many in the public are not aware of the achievements of isro and therefore she wants me to provide some information on the recent launch of 104 satellites and the interceptor missile shobha ji thank you very much for paying attention to this shining example of india s pride whether it is eradicating poverty preventing diseases connecting with the world or disseminating knowledge and information technology and science have made a mark for themselves 15th february 2017 is a day of immense pride for india our scientists have brought laurels to the nation witnessed by the whole world and we know that over the last few years isro has accomplished various unprecedented missions with flying colours after the successful mission of sending mangalyaan to planet mars recently isro scripted a world record in the arena of space in a mega mission isro has successfully launched 104 satellites simultaneously into space these satellites belonged to various countries such as america israel kazakhstan netherlands switzerland uae and of course india india has created history by becoming the first country to launch successfully 104 satellites into space at one go and what is further heartening is the fact that this was pslv s 38th successive successful launch this is a historic achievement for not just isro but for all of india this cost effective efficient space programme of isro has become a marvel for the entire world the world has admired this success of indian scientists of india whole heartedly brother sisters one out of these 104 satellites is extremely important it is cartosat 2d which is india s satellite and the pictures clicked through it will be of great help in mapping of resources and infrastructure evaluating development and planning for urban development particularly for my farmer brothers and sisters our new satellite cartosat 2d will be immensely helpful on a whole lot of subjects such as knowing how much water is there in our existing water sources how this should be best put to use what things to keep in mind in this regard almost immediately after its launch our satellite has sent back some pictures it has commenced functioning it is also a matter of exultation for us that this entire campaign was led and steered by our young scientists our women scientists this tremendous participation of youth and women is a major glorious dimension in isro s success on behalf of our countrymen i heartily congratulate the scientists at isro adhering consistently to the objective of bringing space science to the common man for the service of the nation they are creating one record after another one runs short of words in complimenting and congratulating our scientists their entire team shobha ji has asked one more question and that pertains to the security of india it is about india having acquired a great capability this important matter has not been discussed much but it has drawn shobha ji s attention in the field of defence also india has successfully test fired the ballistic interceptor missile during its trial this missile based on interceptor technology destroyed an enemy missile at an altitude of about 100 km above the surface of the earth and thus marked its success this is a significant cutting edge competency in the arena of security and you will be happy to know that hardly four or five countries in the world possess this capability india s scientists have demonstrated this prowess its core strength lies in the fact that if even from a distance of 2000 km a missile is launched to attack india our missile can pre emptively destroy it in the space itself when we witness new technology or a new scientific feat we are left overwhelmed with joy inquisitiveness has played a significant role in the journey of progression of human life and development and those gifted with extra ordinary intelligence do not let inquisitiveness to remain just that they begin further questioning it look around for newer queries and try to create new realms in the spirit of enquiry this incessant spirit of enquiry leads to new inventions they do not rest till they obtain an answer if we try to take a bird s eye view of thousands of years of the onward march of human life and progress we can easily say that this great journey has no point of culmination a full stop is impossible attempting to know the universe the laws of nature the inner recesses of the human mind is an unending process this is what begets new science new technology and every technology every new form of science gives birth to a new era my dear young friends while we refer to science and the sheer perseverance of scientists i have many a time said in mann ki baat that the attraction of science for our young generation should increase the country needs more and more scientists today s scientist becomes a potent catalyst for enduring change in the lives of our future generations mahatma gandhi used to say no science has dropped from the skies in a perfect form all sciences develop and are built up through experience revered bapu had also remarked i have nothing but praise for the zeal industry and sacrifice that have animated the modern scientists in the pursuit after truth when science is harnessed keeping in minds the needs of common folk when ways and means to naturally use those principles for people s requirements are devised when appropriate mediums and technologies are deliberated upon it paves the way for it to be considered the most valuable contribution for general humanity recently during the 14th pravasi bharatiya diwas niti aayog and india s foreign ministry had organized a unique competition socially useful innovations had been invited these innovations were identified and showcased and people were being informed about them along with touching upon such issues as harnessing them for the use by the common people and their mass production and commercial utilization i saw the volume of remarkable work done in that area to give you an example i came across an innovation for our poor fishermen brethren it is a simple mobile app but it is so powerful that when a fisherman goes to sea for fishing this app is able to provide guidance for direction to locate the most productive fishing zones and also provide multifarious types of information such as the direction and speed of the wind the height of waves and so on this whole array of information is available on this mobile app which can be utilised by our fishermen brethren for moving to those areas with maximum fish presence in a very short time and thus earning their livelihood there are times when a problem portrays the importance of science for finding its solution in 2005 there was a very heavy downpour in mumbai which resulted in flooding and even high tides in the sea leading to terrible hardships whenever a natural calamity strikes it is the underprivileged who are the first in bearing its brunt in that situation two persons worked in right earnest and developed a dwelling structure that saves the house and its occupants mitigates the water logging and can prevent water borne diseases also there were a large number of such innovations what i m trying to infer is that in society in the country there are many who take on such roles and our society is also increasingly turning out to be technology driven systems are getting technology driven in a way technology is becoming an inseparable part of our lives in the recent days one can see a lot of emphasis being laid on digi dhan gradually people are shedding their hard currency mindset and moving towards digital currency digital transactions in india are witnessing a very rapid surge the young generation in particular is getting habituated to digital payments through its mobile handsets i believe this to be a good portent in recent times lucky graahak yojana and digi dhan vyapari yojana have received overwhelming support for about two months now everyday fifteen thousand people have been winning a prize of a thousand rupees each and through these two schemes the process to make digital payment a mass movement has been initiated it has received a rousing welcome in the entire country it is a delight to learn that till now under the digi dhan yojana ten lakh people have been rewarded over fifty thousand traders have won prizes and an amount of almost over a hundred fifty crores rupees has been earned as prize money by people who have promoted and carried forward this great campaign under this scheme there are more than a hundred customers who have received prizes of one lakh rupees each there are more than four thousand traders who have got prizes of fifty thousand rupees each be they farmers traders small entrepreneurs professionals housewives students all are enthusiastically participating and also getting benefits from it when i wanted to know the analysis as to whether it s only the young people who come forward or there are elders persons too i was heartened to learn that among the recipients there were 15 year old young persons as well as elderly people aged 65 70 shriman santosh ji from mysore expressing joy has written on the narendramodiapp that under the lucky grahak yojana he received a reward of a thousand rupees but i feel i must share with you what he has written most prominently he says that when he received this reward it struck him that a poor old woman had lost all her belongings because of a fire that broke out in her house he felt she had more a rightful claim on the reward he had got and gave away the thousand rupees to her and he derived a lot of santosh that is satisfaction through his deed santosh ji your name and your deed both are sources of santosh satisfaction for all of us you have done something that is exemplary and inspiring a 22 year old cab driver brother sabir from delhi adopted the digital mode in his transactions after demonetisation and went on to win a prize of one lakh rupees under the lucky grahak yojana of the government though he continues to be a driver in a way he has now become an ambassador for this scheme he keeps imparting knowledge about digital usage to his passengers all the time he is extremely enthusiastic and motivates others also to go digital one young post graduate student pooja nemade from maharashtra keeps sharing her experience with friends about how her family members are using rupay card and e wallet facilities and deriving enjoyment out of it and also as to how important the prize of rupees one lakh is for her she has taken up this in a mission mode and is bringing others into its fold i urge my countrymen especially the youth of our country and those who have won prizes under lucky grahak yojana or digi dhan vyapar yojana to become ambassadors of these schemes on their own lead this movement take it further as it has a very major and prominent role in the fight against corruption and black money to me each and every individual involved in this mission constitute a new anti corruption cadre in the country in a way you are a soldier in the cause of cleanliness and purity you know that this scheme will complete its 100 days on 14th april the birth anniversary of dr babasaheb ambedkar a truly memorable day there is going to be a very big draw of prizes worth crores of rupees on 14th april there are still about 40 45 days left for that can you do one thing in the memory of babasaheb ambedkar we have recently celebrated 125th birth anniversary of baba saheb ambedkar remembering him you teach at least 125 persons about downloading the bhim app also teach them about the procedure of making transactions through this app teach this specially to small traders in your neighbourhood give special importance to baba saheb ambedkar s birth anniversary this time and the bhim app for this i would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation laid by dr baba saheb we have to go from door to door associating everybody in order to place the bhim app in 125 crore hands since its beginning about two three months ago this movement has had a clear impact and has been a very big success in many townships villages and cities my dear countrymen agriculture makes a very major contribution to the fundamentals of our country s economy economic prowess of villages imparts momentum to the nation s economic progress i wish to share a very happy news with you today our farmer brothers and sisters have toiled hard to fill our granaries the hard work of the farmers has resulted in a record production of food grains all signals indicate that our farmers have broken all previous records there has been such bountiful crop this time in the fields of our farmers that every day has appeared to be a celebration of pongal and baisakhi more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country this year this is 8 percent more than the last record set up by our farmers thus it is an unprecedented achievement in itself i want to specially thank the farmers of the country i also want to thank our farmers for keeping the poor in mind and adopting cultivation of various pulse crops also besides the traditional crops because pulses are the biggest source of protein for poor people i am happy that the farmers of my country heeded the needs of our poor people and cultivated various pulse crops on about 290 lakh hectare land this is not merely the production of pulses but a yeoman service rendered by the farmers to the poor of my country my farmer brothers and sisters deserve special gratitude for the way they whole heartedly accepted my request my prayer and put in their hard labour to get a record production of pulses my dear countrymen the government society institutions organizations in fact everyone is making some or the other effort towards greater cleanliness in a way everyone is seen working towards the cause of cleanliness in a conscious manner the government is continuously making efforts in this regard recently an event was organised in telengana under the leadership of the secretary of our ministry of water and sanitation of the government of india in which senior officers from 23 state governments participated and this was not confined to having just a closed door seminar but the importance of cleanliness was practically demonstrated at warangal in telangana toilet pit emptying exercise was carried out in hyderabad on 17th and 18th february toilet pits in six houses were emptied and cleaned and the officers personally demonstrated that the used up pits of twin pit toilet can be emptied and then re used they also displayed as to how convenient these new technique toilets are and there is absolutely no inconvenience or hesitation in emptying or cleaning these toilets and even the psychological barrier does not come in the way at all and we can ourselves clean these toilet pits just as we do other general cleaning and this exercise showed results media in the country gave it wide publicity and highlighted its importance and it is quite natural also because when people see an ias officer cleaning a toilet pit himself the fact is naturally noticed by the country and we consider the waste taken out from a toilet pit as sheer useless garbage but if considered from the angle of its use as a fertiliser this in a way is black gold we can clearly see the conversion of waste to wealth this has been proved too for a family of six members the model of one standard twin pit toilet gets filled in about five years after that the waste can easily be redirected to the other pit this waste deposited in the pit gets completely decomposed in six to twelve months time this decomposed waste can be safely handled quite conveniently and can be used as npk which is a very useful fertilizer our farmers know npk very well it contains nutritious elements nitrogen phosphorous and potassium in abundance and is considered a fertiliser of very good quality in the agriculture sector others must also have experimented with initiatives similar to those undertaken by the government now doordarshan is broadcasting a special programme of swachchhta samachar that is cleanliness news highlighting such things in this programme will be very beneficial various government departments regularly observe cleanliness fortnight during the first fortnight of march women and child development ministry along with the ministry of tribal affairs will be laying stress on the cleanliness campaign and two other ministries the ministry of shipping and the ministry of water resources river development and ganga rejuvenation will take the cleanliness campaign forward during the last two weeks of march we know that whenever an indian achieves something notable the whole country feels a new energy and the self confidence gets a boost we all hailed the commendable performance by our divyang players at rio paralympics india defeated pakistan in the final of the blind t 20 world cup held earlier this month to become world champions for the second consecutive time and thus raised our national prestige to a new height i once again congratulate all players of our team the country is really proud of these divyang friends for their achievement i always believe that divyang brothers and sisters are capable strongly determined courageous and possess tremendous resolve we get to learn something each moment from them be it the field of sports or space science the women of our country lag behind none they are moving ahead shoulder to shoulder and are bringing glory to the nation with their commendable achievements our women players won a silver medal at the asian rugby sevens trophy recently my heartiest congratulations to all these players the whole world celebrates 8th march as women s day in india also more importance needs to be given to our daughters along with increased awareness and sensitivity towards them beti bachao beti padhao movement is moving forward with rapid strides this is no longer just a government programme it has now become a campaign of societal empathy and public education during the last two years this programme involved the common man it has forced people from all corners of the country to think and ponder over this burning issue and brought about a change in people s thinking about our traditional beliefs and customs which have been prevalent for many years it gives us great joy and happiness when we hear the news of festive celebration on the birth of a daughter in a way a positive mindset towards our daughters is leading towards societal acceptance i have heard that in cuddalore district of tamil nadu child marriage has been banned under a special campaign about 175 child marriages have been prevented so far the district administration has opened bank accounts of over 55 60 thousand daughters under sukanya samridhi yojana in kathua district in jammu kashmir all departments have been connected with beti bachao beti padhao yojana under the convergence model and in addition to the convening of gram sabhas all efforts are being made by the district administrations for adoption of orphan baby girls and to ensure their education in madhya pradesh under the har ghar dastak programme a campaign is being run to go to every village and every house to encourage education of daughters in rajasthan apna bachcha apna vidyalaya campaign is being run to readmit those girls into schools who had dropped out in order to encourage and motivate them to start studying again i mean to say that beti bachao beti padhao movement has also developed in many shapes and forms this entire movement has become a people s movement new imagination and new concepts have been linked and connected with it this movement has been moulded as per local requirements this i believe is a healthy sign as we get ready to celebrate women s day this 8th march there is only one sentiment with strength with vitality the indian woman comes to the fore rightfully deserves equality neither less nor more my dear countrymen all of you get an opportunity to express your views from time to time in mann ki baat you also connect actively with this programme i get to know so many things from you i get to know as to what all is happening on the ground in our villages and in the hearts and minds of the poor i am

our fast moving country the power of digital india is visible in every corner different apps play a big role in taking the power of digital india to every home there is one such app e sanjeevani through this app tele consultation that is while sitting far away through video conference you can consult a doctor about your illness till now the number of tele consultants using this app has crossed the figure of 10 crores you can imagine 10 crore consultations through video conference an amazing bond between patient and doctor this is a big achievement for this achievement i congratulate all the doctors and patients who have availed of this facility this is a living example of how the people of india have made technology a part of their lives we have seen that in the time of corona e sanjeevani app has proved to be a great boon for the people it also occurred to me why not talk about this in mann ki baat with a doctor and a patient communicate and convey the matter to you all let us try to know how effective tele consultation has been for the people with us is dr madan mani ji from sikkim dr madan mani hails from sikkim itself but did his mbbs from dhanbad and then did his md from banaras hindu university he has provided tele consultation to hundreds of people in rural areas prime minister namaskar namaskar madan mani ji dr madan mani ji namaskar sir prime minister this is narendra modi speaking dr madan mani yes yes sir prime minister you have studied in banaras dr madan mani yes i have studied in banaras sir prime minister your medical education took place there dr madan mani yes yes prime minister so did you ever go to see the banaras of that time when you were there earlier and the changed banaras of today dr madan mani ji prime minister ji i have not been able to visit since i have come back to sikkim but i have heard that a lot has changed prime minister so how many years have passed since you left banaras dr madan mani i have left banaras since 2006 sir prime minister o then you must go dr madan mani yes yes prime minister well i called because you are providing great services of teleconsultation to the people of sikkim living in remote mountains dr madan mani ji prime minister i would like to share your experience with the listeners of mann ki baat dr madan mani yes prime minister tell me how was the experience dr madan mani it was a great experience prime minister ji the fact is the nearest phc in sikkim to go there also people have to board a vehicle and carry at least one or two hundred rupees and whether a doctor would be available this is also a problem so through tele consultation we connect directly with people with people from faraway places the chos of health wellness centres get them connected with us and they tell us the reports of their old ailments their present condition everything prime minister that means you transfer the documents dr madan mani yes yes we also transfer documents and if they are unable to transfer they read out and tell us prime minister the doctor of the wellness center there conveys dr madan mani yes the cho who lives in the wellness center community health officer prime minister and the one who is a patient tells you about his difficulties directly dr madan mani yes the patient also tells us about his difficulties then after seeing the old records if we want to know any new things for example one has to auscultate someone s chest if his feet are swollen or not if the cho has not seen it then we tell him to go and see whether there is swelling or not look at the eyes whether he has anaemia or not if he has cough then auscultate the chest and find out whether there are sounds there or not prime minister do you talk through voice call or do you also use video call dr madan mani yes we use video call prime minister so you see the patient as well dr madan mani can see the patient also sir prime minister what feeling does the patient get dr madan mani the patient likes it because he can see the doctor closely he is confused whether his medicine has to be increased or decreased because most of the patients in sikkim are of diabetes and hypertension and how far he will have to go to find a doctor to change the medicine for diabetes and hypertension but through tele consultation it is available there and medicine is also available through free drugs initiative in the health wellness center so the patient avails of the medicine from there itself prime minister well madan mani ji you know that the patient has a tendency that until the doctor comes until the doctor sees him he is not satisfied and the doctor also feels that he will have to see the patient now since all the consultations there are done through telecom what does the doctor feel what does the patient feel dr madan mani ji we also feel that if the patient feels that he should see the doctor then whatever things we want to see we by speaking to cho in the video only we ask to see and sometimes by coming close to the patient in the video itself the problems he is facing if someone has a skin problem then he shows us through the video itself so those people remain satisfied prime minister and later after treating him does he get satisfaction what does he feel are patients getting well dr madan mani yes i get a lot of satisfaction we also get satisfaction sir because i am currently in the health department and simultaneously do tele consultation it is a very good pleasant experience for me to see the patient along with the file prime minister on an average how many patients would be there through tele consultation cases dr madan mani so far i have seen 536 patients prime minister oh that means you have mastered it a lot dr madan mani yes it feels good prime minister okay i wish you all the best by using this technology you are doing such a great service to the people living in the remote forests and mountains of sikkim and it is a matter of joy that such a good use of technology is being made even in the far flung areas of our country fine many congratulations to you from my side dr madan mani thank you friends it is clear from the words of dr madan mani how e sanjeevani app is helping them after dr madan ji we now join another madan ji this is madan mohan lal ji a resident of chandauli district of uttar pradesh now it is also a coincidence that chandauli is also adjacent to banaras come let us know from madan mohan ji what his experience as a patient regarding e sanjeevani has been prime minister madan mohan ji pranam madan mohan ji namaskar namaksar sir prime minister namaskar well i have been told that you are a diabetic patient madan mohan ji yes yes prime minister and you take help of technology regarding your illness through teleconsultation madan mohan ji ji ji prime minister as a patient i want to listen to your experiences so that i would like to convey to our countrymen how the people living in our villages can use today s technology tell me how do you do it madan mohan ji it is like this sir hospitals are far away and when i got diabetes i had to travel 5 6 kms away to get treatment done to consult on it and since the arrangement has been made by you means that i go now i am examined it also makes us talk to doctors from outside and also provides us medicines it is of great benefit to me and other people are also benefited by it prime minister so every time is it the same doctor that sees you or the doctors keep changing madan mohan ji since they don t understand they show it to the doctor it talks to us and makes us talk to another doctor prime minister and the guidance that doctors give you you get full benefit from it madan mohan ji we are benefited we have a great benefit through that and the people of the village also benefit from it everyone there asks that brother we have bp we have sugar test check tell us about the medicine and earlier they used to go 5 6 kilometres away there used to be long queues there used to be queues in pathology there used to be a loss of an entire day s time prime minister meaning your time is also saved madan mohan ji and money was also wasted and here all services are being done free of cost prime minister well when you see the doctor in person in front of you a trust is formed okay here s a doctor he has checked my pulse my eyes he has also checked my

advantage of it be it india s e sanjeevaniapp or upi these have proved to be very helpful in raising the ease of living my dear countrymen when a species of bird a living being which is going extinct in a country is saved it is discussed all over the world there are many such great traditions in our country which had disappeared had been removed from the minds and hearts of the people but now efforts are being made to revive them with the power of public participation so for discussing that what better platform than mann ki baat what i am going to tell you now will make you really happy you will be proud of our heritage shriman kanchan banerjee who lives in america has drawn my attention to one such campaign related to the preservation of heritage i congratulate him friends this month tribeni kumbho mohotshav was organized in bansberia of hooghly district in west bengal more than eight lakh devotees participated in it but do you know why it is so special it is special since this practice has been revived after 700 years although this tradition is thousands of years old but unfortunately this festival which used to take place in tribeni bengal was stopped 700 years ago it should have been started after independence but that too could not happen two years ago the festival has been started again by the local people and through tribeni kumbho porichalona shomiti i congratulate all the people associated with its organization you are not only keeping alive a tradition but are also protecting the cultural heritage of india friends tribeni in west bengal has been known as a holy place for centuries it finds mention in various mangalakavya vaishnava literature shakta literature and other bangla literary works various historical documents suggest that this region was once a centre of sanskrit education and indian culture many saints consider it a holy place for kumbh snan on magh sankranti in tribeni you will find many ganga ghats shiva temples and ancient buildings decorated with terracotta architecture kumbh mela was organized here last year to restore the cultural heritage of tribeni and revive the glory of kumbh tradition seven centuries later the three day kumbh mahasnan and the fair have infused a new energy into the region a large number of people participated in the ganga aarti rudrabhishek and yajna that took place every day for three days various ashrams mutths and akhadas were also included in the festival this time various genres related to bengali traditions such as kirtan baul godiyo nritto sree khol poter gaan chou nach became the center of attraction in the evening programmes this is a very commendable effort to connect our youth with the golden past of the country there are many other such practices in india which need to be revived i hope that the discussion about them will definitely inspire people in this direction my dear countrymen swachh bharat abhiyan has changed the meaning of public participation in our country if something related to cleanliness takes place anywhere in the country people certainly inform me about it that s how my attention was drawn to a cleanliness campaign by the youth of haryana there is a village in haryana dulhedi the youth here decided that bhiwani city has to be made exemplary in terms of cleanliness he formed an organization called yuva swachhta evam janseva samiti the youth associated with this committee reach bhiwani at 4 in the morning together they run cleanliness drives at different places in the city these people have so far cleared tons of garbage from different areas of the city friends waste to wealth is also an important dimension of the swachh bharat abhiyan kamala moharana a sister from kendrapada district of odisha runs a self help group the women of this group make many things like baskets and mobile stands from milk pouches and other plastic packing materials this is becoming a good source of income for them along with ensuring cleanliness if we resolve we can make a huge contribution towards a clean india at least we all should take a pledge to replace plastic bags with cloth bags you will see how much satisfaction your

having thought of a separate time slot friends every day is a new day weeks and months keep seeing change years witness transformation except for the enthusiasm and fervor of the people of india and of course we are no less we are certain to outdo ourselves the spirit of can do is emerging as a new resolve the sentiment of contributing positively to the country society is gaining strength day by day friends we have come together once again on the dais of mann ki baat this is to discuss newer subjects to celebrate the latest achievements of our countrymen in fact to celebrate india mann ki baat has emerged as a fruitful frank effortless organic platform for sharing learning and growing together every month thousands of people share their suggestions their efforts and their experiences thereby and through the endeavour we get a chance to discuss some extraordinary feats by people which serve as a beacon of inspiration to society somebody has succeeded in doing something can we too achieve that can that particular venture be replicated to bring about a colossal transformation in the entire country can we establish that change into permanence turning it into a simple natural social habit in a likewise quest to seek answers the caravan of mann ki baat progresses with a few appeals some invocations and a lot of resolves to do something for the past many years we would have made varied resolves just as no to single use plastic buying khadi or local sanitation cleanliness respect honour for the girl child or emphasizing on the new aspect of less cash economy many a resolve such as these came into being on account of our conversations chats through mann ki baat and you have been the ones who strengthened that i have received a lovely letter written by shriman shailesh from bihar in fact he no longer stays in bihar he says he stays in delhi working for an ngo shailesh writes modi ji you appeal to us on one point or the other in every episode of mann ki baat i have implemented many of them in letter spirit this winter i collected warm clothes from people going home to home and distributed them to the needy taking a cue from mann ki baat i have embarked upon many initiatives but gradually i began forgetting certain things started fading away this new year i have made a charter pertaining to mann ki baat consisting of a list of all these just the way people make resolutions at the onset of the new year modi ji this is my social resolution for this new year i feel there are many little things that can usher in a big change can you inscribe your

is very innovative i shall certainly send it back to you along with my best wishes inscribed friends when i was glancing through this mann ki baat charter i was taken aback at the magnitude of its contents a multitude of hash tags and of course we have striven together on myriad endeavours there have been times when we tried to establish a stronger emotional connect with our soldiers through the campaign sandesh to soldiers we have also catapulted sales of khadi with khadi for nation khadi for fashion we internalized the mantra of buy local through hum fit toh india fit we enhanced awareness towards fitness we turned sanitation into a mass movement through the endeavours of my clean india or statue cleaning no to drugs bharat ki lakshmi self for society stress free exams suraksha bandhan digital economy road safety oh the list is endless shailesh ji you must have realized after going through this mann ki baat charter that the list is indeed long come let us continue this journey do join any cause of your choice listed in the mann ki baat charter using the hashtag proudly share your contribution with one all try motivating friends family when every indian takes a step forward it results in india going ahead by a 130 crore steps and that s why it is said charaivetee charaivetee charaivetee keep walking keep marching keep advancing your endeavour should revolve around that mantra my dear countrymen we touched upon the mann ki baat charter the ethos of public participation besides in the area of sanitation is rising rapidly on another front and that is water conservation quite a few extensive innovative efforts are under way in every corner of the country for the sake of conserving water it gives me joy to let you know that the jal shakti campaign that commenced last monsoon is taking rapid successful strides with the aid of public participation a large number of lakes ponds have been built and the best part is that in this campaign people from all strata of society contributed wholeheartedly take for instance jalore district in rajasthan there two historical step wells had turned into storehouses of garbage dirty water but one fine day hundreds of people from bhadraayun thanawala panchayats took a resolve to rejuvenate them under the jal shakti campaign much before the rains people immersed themselves in the task of cleaning out the accumulated filthy water garbage and morass for this campaign some donated money others their labour sweat as a result these step wells have turned into their lifelines now a similar story comes across from barabanki in uttar pradesh here the saraahi lake spread across 43 hectares was on the verge of breathing its last but the villagers through the power of their collective resolve pumped life into it they did not let any deterrent enter in the way of this mammoth mission villages joined hands one after the other they built a one meter high embankment along all the four sides of the lake the lake now is brimming with water the surroundings wake up to the melody of the chirping of birds village suniyakot along the almora haldwani highway in uttarakhand has also emerged as a similar example of public participation to tide over an acute water crisis villagers took it upon themselves to ensure that water reached their village there was no stopping to their resolve people raised money among themselves the plan was followed by collective donation of labour and from almost a kilometre away a pipe was laid upto the village a pumping station was set up by and by a two decade old agonizing problem came to an end whereas a very innovative idea of harnessing a borewell for rainwater harvesting sprung up from tamilnadu the country is replete with innumerable such stories of water conservation lending more strength to the resolves of new india today the entire country is eager to hear similar accomplishments of our jal shakti champions i urge you to share without fail stories photos videos of such endeavours of water conservation and water harvesting undertaken by you or those around you using jalshakti4india my dear countrymen and especially all my young friends today through the forum of mann ki baat i congratulate the government and the people of assam for being the excellent hosts of khelo india friends on 22nd january the third khelo india games concluded in guwahati these games had around 6 thousand players from different states participating you will be surprised to know that 80 records were broken during this grand sports festival and i am proud that of these 80 records 56 were broken by our daughters these laurels have been recorded in the name of our daughters i along with all the winners congratulate all the participants i also thank all the people coaches and technical officers associated with khelo india games for organising them successfully it is very pleasant for all of us to learn that the participation of athletes in khelo india games is on the upsurge year after year and this also tells you about the increasing inclination towards sports in our school children i wish to tell all of you that in 2018 when khelo india games were instituted thirty five hundred players took part but in just three years the number of players has increased to more than 6 thousand which translates to the fact that it has almost doubled not only this in just three years through khelo india games thirty two hundred gifted children have emerged on the sporting horizon many of these children grew up amidst dearth and poverty the stories of the patience and determination of these children who participated in khelo india games as well as their parents will inspire every indian now take the example of purnima mandal of guwahati a sanitation worker in guwahati municipal corporation but whereas her daughter malvika showed her mettle in football one of her sons sujit represented assam in kho kho while the other son pradeep did the same in hockey somewhat similar is the story of yogananthan of tamil nadu which fills you with great pride yogananthanmakesbeedis in tamil nadu but his daughter purnashree won everyone s heart by bagging the gold medal in weight lifting if i now take the name of david beckham you will think whether i m referring to the legendary international footballer but now we also have a david beckham amidst us and he has won a gold medal at the youth games in guwahati that too in the 200 meter sprint event in cycling and for me this means double joy you know some time ago i had visited andaman nicobar islands there was david a denizen of car nicobar who had lost his parents while he was an infant his uncle wanted him to become a footballer and hence had named him after the famous footballer but young david was obsessed with cycling he was selected under the khelo india scheme and today you can witness for yourself that he has created a new record in cycling prashant singh kanhaiya of bhiwani broke his own national record in the pole vault event prashant 19 hails from an agrarian family you will be surprised to know that prashant used to practice pole vault on clay after knowing this amazing fact the sports department helped his coach to run the academy at jawaharlal nehru stadium delhi and today prashant is being coached there the never say die story of kareena shankta of mumbai inspires everyone kareena competed in the 100 metre breast stroke event in swimming won the gold medal in the under 17 category and also set a new national record however there was a time for kareena a 10th standard student when she had to forego her training due to a knee injury but kareena and her mother did not lose courage and the result of that fortitude is evident in front of all of us today i wish all the players a bright future along with this i also on behalf of all our countrymen bow in honouring those parents who did not permit poverty to become a hurdle for the future of their children we all know that national games is an arena where players get a chance to display their passion besides becoming acquainted with the culture of other states therefore we have decided to organize khelo india university games every year on the pattern of khelo india youth games friends next month the first edition of khelo india university games is being organized in cuttack and bhubaneswar odisha from 22nd february to 1st march and more than 3000 players have qualified for participating in these games my dear countrymen the exam season has arrived and obviously all the students will be busy giving final shape to their preparations after my experience with millions of students of the country through the platform of pariksha pe charcha i can say with confidence that the youth of the country is brimming with self confidence and is ready to face every challenge friends on the one hand we are facing examinations on the other the winter season betwixt these two i urge you to try keep fit do some exercises or play a little sports games is the key to keeping fit by the way these days i see that many events pertaining to fit india are being organised on january 18 our young friends organized a cyclothon throughout the country millions of countrymen participating in this cyclothon spread the message of fitness efforts to ensure that our new india remains fit that are evident at every level fills us with fervour enthusiasm the fit india school campaign which started in november last year is also bringing results i have been told that till date more than 65 000 schools have obtained the fit india school certificates through online registration i urge the rest of the schools in the country to integrate physical activity and sports with education and ensure that they become a fit school also concomitantly i appeal to all countrymen to promote more physical activity in their daily routine remind yourself every day that if we are fit india is fit my dear countrymen a couple of weeks ago different parts of india were celebrating a variety of festivals when punjab was spreading the warmth of enthusiasm by celebrating lohri sisters and borthers of tamil nadu were celebrating pongal and birth anniversary of thiruvalluvar assam was aglow with the fascinating lustre of bihu in gujarat everywhere you could see kites in the sky and the pomp of uttaraayan in such an atmosphere delhi witnessed a historic event a significant agreement was signed in delhi with it the close to 25 year old bru reang refugee crisis a painful chapter was put to an end forever and ever due to the busy routine and festive season you might not have been able to learn about this historic agreement in detail so i thought i should definitely discuss this in mann ki baat this problem pertains to the 90s in 1997 ethnic tension forced the bru reang tribe to leave mizoram and take refuge in tripura these refugees were kept in temporary camps in kanchanpur in north tripura it s painful that the bru reang community lost a significant part of their life as refugees life in camps meant that they were deprived of all basic amenities for 23 years no home no land no medical treatment for their families no education facilities for their kids just imagine how difficult it must have been for them to live 23 long years in trying circumstances in camps how painful it would have been to spend every moment every day of their lives hurtling towards an uncertain future governments came and went but there was no cure for their pain despite that their unwavering belief in the indian constitution and culture continued it s a result of that belief that their life is on the threshold of a new dawn today as per the agreement the path to a dignified life has been opened for them finally the new decade of 2020 has brought a new ray of hope in the life of the bru reang community around 34000 bru refugees will be rehabilitated in tripura not just that the government will provide an assistance of close to rs 600 crores for their rehabilitation and all round development each displaced family will be provided a plot of land they will be assisted in construction of a house in addition rations will be provided to them they will now be able to benefit from the public welfare schemes of the state and central governments this agreement is special for many reasons it symbolises the spirit of cooperative federalism the chief ministers of both mizoram and tripura were present during the signing of the agreement this agreement was made possible only because of the consent and good wishes of people from both the states i would like to especially express my gratitude to the people and the chief ministers of both the states for making this possible this agreement also epitomises the inherent compassion and sensitivity of indian culture considering everyone as its own and living with the spirit of togetherness is embedded in the ethos of this holy land i would once again like to congratulate the residents of these states and the bru reang community my dear countrymen assam which hosted the grand khelo india games successfully was witness to another great achievement you might also have seen it in the news that a few days ago 644 militants pertaining to 8 different militant groups surrendered with their weapons those who had strayed twards the path of violence have expressed their faith in peace and decided to become a partner in the country s progress and return to the mainstream last year in tripura as well more than 80 people left the path of violence and returned to the mainstream those who had picked up weapons thinking that violence could solve problems now firmly believe that the only way to solve any dispute is peace and togetherness countrymen will be thrilled to know that insurgency in the north east has considerably reduced and the biggest reason for that is that every issue of this region is being honestly and peacefully solved through dialogue on the solemn occasion of republic day i would appeal to anyone in any part of the country who s still seeking solutions to problems through violence and weapons to return to the mainstream they should have faith in their own capabilities and the capabilities of this country to resolve issues peacefully we live in the 21st century that is the era of knowledge science and democracy have you ever heard of a place where life has turned better due to violence have you ever heard of a place where peace and goodwill have been impediments in the quest of a good life violence never resolves any issue no problem in the world can be solved by creating another problem it can only be solved by seeking an optimal solution come let s together forge a new india where every issue is resolved on a platform of peace solidarity should be the key to resolving every issue and brotherhood should foil every separatist attempt to divide us my dear countrymen on the solemn occasion of republic day it gives me great joy to tell you about gaganyaan the country has taken another step towards this goal in 2022 we will be celebrating 75 years of independence and on that occasion we have to fulfil the pledge to take an indian into space through the gaganyaan mission gaganyaan mission will be a historic achievement in the field of science and technology for india in the 21st century it will prove to be a milestone for new india friends you would be aware that four candidates have been already selected as astronauts for this mission all of them are pilots of the indian air force these promising youngsters symbolise india s skill talent ability courage and dreams our four friends are about to go to russia in a few days for their training i am confident that this would script another golden chapter in india russia friendship and cooperation they will be trained for over a year after that the responsibility of carrying the hopes and aspirations of the nation and soaring into space will rest on the shoulders of one of them on the auspicious occasion of republic day i congratulate these four youngsters and the indian and russian scientists and engineers associated with this mission my dear countrymen in march last year a video had become the centre of attention in the media and the social media the buzz was about how a 107 year old elderly motherly figure broke the protocol to bless the president this lady was saalumarada timmakka who is famous in karnataka as vriksha maataa tree mother and the ceremony was the padma awards distribution the country recognised and honoured the extraordinary contribution of timmakka who comes from an ordinary background she was being decorated with the padma shri award ceremony friends today india feels proud of such great personalities and feels honoured to honour such down to earth rooted individuals like every year last evening padma awards were announced i urge you to read up about each of the awardees discuss their contribution with your family this year over 46000 nominations were received for the 2020 padma awards this number is more than 20 times the number of nominations received in 2014 this statistic reveals the faith of every one of us and tells us that the padma awards have now become the peoples awards the entire process of the padma awards is now completed online earlier the decision was taken by a select few now it s completely people driven we could even say that there is now a new found faith and respect for these awards in the country many among the awardees are those who have risen

26-Jul-15,"In his July 26, 2015 address, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted various significant topics. He lauded the increase in pulse and oilseed production, emphasizing the importance of farmers in the country. The speech coincided with Kargil Vijay Diwas, and Modi paid tribute to the sacrifices of Indian soldiers during the war. He also spoke about the success of MyGov.in, a citizen participation platform. The Prime Minister encouraged people to suggest topics for his upcoming Independence Day speech. Modi addressed the critical issue of road safety, emphasizing the need to reduce accidents and promote awareness. He praised initiatives like ""Operation Malyuddh"" to improve hygiene and cleanliness. The speech showcased positive stories of civic engagement, including citizens' efforts to build toilets and improve villages. The Prime Minister called for greater interest in science and technology among the youth and discussed the importance of 24-hour electricity supply in rural areas. The address concluded with Modi extending his best wishes for the upcoming festivals in August and September and requesting suggestions from the public for his Independence Day speech.",26-jul-2015 my dear countrymen namaskar this year the rains have started on a good note this will definitely prove beneficial to our farmer brothers and sisters in sowing of kharif crops i am very pleased to share an immensely good news with you all we have always faced scarcity of pulses and oilseeds in our country poor people require pulses and some amount of oil to prepare vegetables for their food the good news for me is that there has been an increase of approximately 50 in the production of pulses and an increase of around 33 in the production of oilseeds i would especially like to congratulate and compliment all my farmer brothers and sisters for this achievement my dear countrymen 26th july is marked as kargil vijay diwas in the history of our country the intensity with which the farmers are connected with their land our soldiers too are connected with the land in the same degree during the kargil war each one of our soldier proved mightier than hundreds of soldiers of our enemies i would like to salute all our brave soldiers who thwarted the attempts by our enemies without caring for their lives kargil war was not limited to just our borders but each of our cities villages contributed in this war this war was fought by those mothers and sisters whose sons and brothers were fighting against the enemies at the border this war was also fought by the daughters of our country who were newly married and their henna were still fresh on their hands also by the proud fathers who saw themselves as soldiers seeing their sons fighting for the country and also by that infant who had not even learnt to walk catching his father s fingers it is because of these unmatchable sacrifices that our country is proudly standing on its feet in front of the entire world hence i would like to salute all these valiant warriors on this occasion of kargil vijay diwas there is another reason why i consider 26th july quite important because mygov in was launched a few months after our government was formed our pledge was to promote citizen participation in democracy and connect every citizen in the development work and today i am pleased to share this after one year that nearly two crore people have visited mygov website we have received comments from five and a half lac people and i am extremely glad to mention that more than fifty thousand people took out time from their precious schedule to apply their mind and provide their suggestions on pmo applications as they considered this work important and we have received quite significant suggestions one of the suggestions sent from mr akhilesh vajpayee from kanpur is to provide separate quota to the disabled for booking tickets on irctc website it is quite unfair that the disabled citizens have to go through the same tiring procedure and buy tickets at the railway station though this is a very minor issue but the government never took note of it or thought about the same previously but on the suggestion of our brother akhilesh vajpayee our government looked into this suggestion seriously and we have implemented this facility in our system for our disabled brothers and sisters we are receiving quite positive suggestions on mygov it is helping in getting assistance in creating logos tag lines and formulating policies by yourselves we are experiencing fresh air in the administrative system we are experiencing a new sense of consciousness i am even receiving suggestion on mygov that what should be my speech on 15th of august we have received quite a few suggestions from suchitra raghavachari from chennai in this regard she has suggested me to speak on the topics like save our daughters educate a girl child clean ganges swachh bharat with this i got an idea and i am requesting you all to send suggestions about what should be the topics for my 15th august speech you can send in your suggestions through mygov letters to radio or write letters to the pm s office look i believe that this will be a great initiative to include people s suggestion in framing my speech for 15th august i believe that you will send your good suggestions i would like to talk about an issue which is a matter of great concern i neither want to sermonize nor i am trying to find an escape route towards my responsibilities pertaining to state government central government or units of local self government institutions two days ago a visual of an accident in delhi caught my attention wherein the victim on scooter was fighting for his life for ten minutes post the accident he did not receive any help from the passers by in general also i have noticed that i have been receiving suggestions to speak on road safety and make the people aware of this be it hoshakote akshay from bengaluru ameya joshi from pune or prasanna kakunje from mudbidri karnataka all these all people have written to me there are many other names which i am not being able to mention and have raised their concerns i agree that whatever you have put forth is valid my heart shivers when i look at the statistics of accidents we are witnessing an accident every minute in our country due to these road accidents we are witnessing one death every four minutes in our country it is a matter of huge concern that out of these deaths nearly one third of the victims comprise the youth ranging from 15 to 25 years of age group and such death shakes the very foundation of an entire family the government system will continue to work towards this but i would like to request all the parents to make their children aware of all the safety rules pertaining to driving a two wheeler or a four wheeler the families should encourage discussion of road safety at home and create an atmosphere about the same to promote road safety we have seen few lines written at the back of auto rickshaws papa come home early and after reading it we are so touched by it and therefore i say that the government has taken a lot of new initiatives in this regard be it the initiative of education on road safety initiative related to road engineering or of enforcement of road safety laws and the discussion on emergency care to be provided post accidents we are going to implement road transport and safety bill to adopt these safety measures in our country in the coming days we are also planning to take many important measures for implementing national road safety policy and road safety action plan we have undertaken another project called cashless treatment in gurgaon jaipur and vadodara to mumbai ranchi rangaon and mundiya national highway and it will be further extended the cashless treatment refers to the policy for the first fifty hours post accident one need worry if one has money or not who will pay the bills leaving all this worry one has to give primary importance to the road accident victim who is injured so that he is treated and provided the best hospital facilities at the earliest we have started a toll free number 1033 for providing information about incidents across the country and ambulance service but all these are services are for post accidents one must strive to avoid accidents first but it is also important for us to see from the perspective that each and every soul each and every life is precious sometimes i say that the government employees to be karma yogis or selfless workers i recalled a few incidents in the last few days which i liked and hence would like to share with you sometimes people get tired of their continuous jobs in the initial few years the attitude is okay i get my salary so i will work however i came across an incident of a railway department a few days ago wherein a railway tte vijay biswal from nagpur division who is gifted with painting prowess could have has chosen to showcase his skills related to any field but he continues to work with the railways and paints various scenes related to railways only through this he gets an inner satisfaction for his job and also enjoys his hobby at the same time using his example we can learn how to bring more life to our own jobs vijay biswal has shown us how we can connect our jobs with our hobbies interests or skills who knows vijay biswal s work may get recognised by his paintings across the nation in the near future i have come to know about a very inspiring work started by the entire team of government officials in harda district madhya pradesh these bunch of officials with their entire team have started such a work which has touched me immensely and i really liked it and the work they have started is operation malyuddh and upon hearing this you will feel that this subject will go in a certain direction but the key focus of this operation is to give a new direction to swachh bharat abhiyaan they are working on brother number one operation in which the best brother has to gift one toilet to his sister on the occasion of raksha bandhan they are influencing all the brothers to gift toilet to their sisters so that all the mothers and sisters of the district avoid going to toilet in the open this operation has given a new meaning to raksha bandhan and i would like to congratulate the entire government team of harda district for this initiative i came across a news a few days back and these small news really gives me immense pleasure and i would like to share the same with you there exists a small village called keshla in rajnandgaon chhattisgarh the inhabitants of this village from last few months tried and lead a campaign for building toilets in the village now nobody from this village has to go to toilet in the open after the completion of this campaign the entire village celebrated this accomplishment just like a mega festival these finest examples coming up to me show how our society is bringing change in human values and human mind and how the citizens of this country are taking the nation forward bhavesh deka from guwahati has written to me on the north east related issues and problems i must say that north east people are quite active i really appreciate that they write about a lot of issues i would like to tell them with great pleasure that we have a separate ministry for north eastern region during the government of atal bihari vajpayee as our prime minister a doner ministry called development of north east region was formed after our government was formed the doner department took an important decision of not staying in delhi and working from centre for the north east regions instead it was decided to send the government officials and their team on a seven days camp to north east states like nagaland arunachal pradesh tripura assam and sikkim these officials would visit the districts villages and meet the local government officials and talk to people s representatives and the citizens of those regions they will listen to their problems and direct the government in taking appropriate measures in solving those problems this initiative will bring a fruitful result in the near future the officials who will visit these states would realize the beauty of these states and will feel very determined to work for the development of these states and to fix the problems of these states when they return with this pledge they can easily understand the problems of these states even when they reach delhi this is a great initiative to go far off from delhi to east and this act is called act east policy my dear countrymen we are extremely delighted and proud of the mars mission success india s pslv c 28 has launched five uk satellites which are the heaviest satellites launched by india till date such news remain in the flashlight for few moments and are gone we often do not remember these achievements for a long time i am often worried by this thought that we speak to the youth of our nation and ask about their dream job only one out of 100 would express their interest in becoming a scientist youth is losing their interest in science which is a matter of great concern science and technology is a type of dna for development the youth of our country should dream about becoming a scientist and imbibe interests in the field of research and innovation their capabilities should be monitored and must be assisted in the right direction to achieve success in this field ministry of human resource development govt of india has initiated a national discovery campaign it was inaugurated by india s ex president dr a p j abdul kalam as a part of this campaign iit nit central and state universities being their mentor and guide are going to educate and motivate the aspiring students to choose the right path in their career i always press upon the ias officers of our government who have reached such heights with their vast intellect and education that they should visit the nearby schools and colleges and share their knowledge for just two to four hours in a week your experience and intellect would certainly help the new generation to some extent we have raised a very big issue regarding the supply of 24 hours electricity in the villages of our country this work is difficult but it must be done we have auspiciously inaugurated this scheme and the villages will get a supply of 24 hours electricity in the coming years the students of the villages should not be affected with the shortage of electricity during their exams there should be enough electricity for starting a small industry today the villagers have to go to other villagers for charging their mobile phones the villages should be provided with all the facilities that are available in the cities for this purpose we have launched deendayal upadhyaya gram jyoti programme i am aware that this country is quite vast and we have to reach the villages and far off corners of the country we have to run for the development of the poor we will achieve this goal and it is already in progress we will certainly achieve this today through mann ki baat i felt like expressing these myriad of thoughts in a way in our country the months of august and september are the months for celebration of festivals there are lots of festivals in these months my greetings to all of you for the same please do send your suggestions for 15th august your opinions will really help me thank you very much to you all ,26th july is marked as kargil vijay diwas in the history of our country the intensity with which farmers are connected with their land our soldiers too are connected to the land in the same degree during the Kargil war each one of our soldier proved mightier than hundreds of soldiers of our enemies
26-Jul-20,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on July 26, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reflected on the occasion of Kargil Vijay Diwas, commemorating the victory of the Indian Army in the Kargil War. He emphasized the importance of remembering the sacrifices made by the soldiers and their families and encouraged citizens to share stories of bravery and sacrifice on social media. The Prime Minister stressed the need for unity, especially on social media, and how the country's strength lies in its collective unity. He also discussed the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, urging continued vigilance and the use of preventive measures. He highlighted the inspiring stories of individuals across the country who are contributing to the fight against COVID-19. In a conversation with young achievers from different parts of India, he encouraged them to keep excelling and shared their dreams and aspirations. Prime Minister Modi also mentioned the Indian diaspora in Suriname, where people of Indian origin make up a significant part of the population, and celebrated the recent swearing-in of the new President of Suriname who took his oath using Vedic hymns and Sanskrit. In closing, he extended his Independence Day greetings, urging people to take a pledge for a self-reliant India and strive for national development, drawing inspiration from great leaders like Lokmanya Tilak on the centenary of his passing.",26-jul-2020 my dear countrymen namaskar today is the 26th of july a very special day it is kargil vijay diwas it was on this very day 21 years ago our army unfurled the flag of victory in the battle of kargil friends india can never forget the circumstances under which the battle of kargil took place pakistan had embarked upon this misadventure nursing delusions of encroaching upon indian soil to distract attention from the internal strife prevailing there india was then in the process of making efforts to foster good relations with pakistan but as it is said which means to the wicked enmity with one and all for no reason comes naturally people with such a disposition keep thinking of harming even their well wishers that is why when india extended a hand of friendship pakistan tried to respond stabbing in the back but after that when our gallant army displayed deeds of valour when india demonstrated her might the whole world watched it you can imagine the enemy lodged in soaring mountainous heights and our armed forces our brave soldiers fighting from down below but it was not about victoriously conquering the heights it was the victory of high morale and bravery of our armed forces in the truest sense of the term friends at that point of time i too was blessed with the opportunity to go to kargil and witness the gallantry of our jawans that day is one of the most precious moments of my life i am noticing today people are reminiscing the kargil victory throughout the country on social media they are saluting their brave heart heroes and paying tributes to those martyred with the courage in kargil today i on behalf of all countrymen salute the brave soldiers and along with them i also salute the brave mothers who gave rise to the real heroes sons of mother india i urge the youth of the country to share stories of the heroic deeds of our brave hearts and sacrifices on part of the brave mothers throughout the day friends today i call upon you to visit the website positively there you will come across an array of information on our brave warriors and tales of their valour and when you discuss these with your friends they will become a source of inspiration you must certainly visit this website infact i would like to insist on multiple visits friends what atal ji had said from red fort during the kargil war is relevant to all of us even today atal ji had then reminded the nation of a mantra of gandhi ji mahatma gandhi s mantra was in the face of any dilemma in order to decide what to do or what not to do one must think of the poorest and the most helpless person of india one must assess whether one s deed will result in benefitting that particular person or not going beyond gandhi ji s thought atal ji had said that the kargil war has given us another mantra and the mantra was before taking any important decision we should think whether our step our endeavor is befitting to the honour of the soldier who laid down his life in those remote mountains come let us listen to the sentiment in the very voice of atal ji let us understand it the time too has come to accept it sound byte all of us remember that gandhi ji had given us a mantra he had said that in the face of any dilemma in order to decide what to do you should think of the poorest and the most helpless person of india ask yourself whether your deed will result in benefiting that particular person kargil has given us another mantra and the mantra was before taking any important decision we should think whether our step our endeavor is befitting to the honour of the soldier who laid down his life in those remote mountains friends in times of war whatever we say or do has immense bearing on the morale of the soldier ever vigilant at the border as well as the morale of his family we should never forget this and that is why our conduct our demeanour our speech our statements our limits our aims whatever we do and say must distinctly be conducive to enhancing the morale honour of our soldiers countrymen bound by a thread of unity with the mantra that the nation is above everything else bolster the strength of our soldiers much more than thousand fold we are aware of the dictum sanghe shakti kalau yuge the essence of which tells us that there is strength in unity in the present era at times without paying heed to the essence we encourage certain things on social media that are detrimental to the country there are times when we keep forwarding things out of sheer curiosity despite knowing that it is wrong we keep doing it these days battles are fought not just on borders they are fought within the country too on many fronts simultaneously and every countryman has to decide his or her role in that we too should determine our roles fully bearing in mind soldiers fighting on the borders under the harshest conditions my dear countrymen over the last few months the way the country fought against corona unitedly has proven many apprehensions wrong today the recovery rate in our country is better compared to other countries the mortality rate in the context of corona in our country is much less as well compared to most countries of course the loss of even one life is saddening but india has also succeeded in saving the lives of millions of her people but friends the hazards of corona are far from being over at many places it is spreading fast we need to be extra vigilant we have to bear in mind that corona is as fatal today as it was in the beginning that s why we have to be fully cautions wearing a face mask using a gamchcha or a light towel to cover two yard distancing frequently washing hands avoiding spitting anywhere taking full care of hygiene sanitation these are our weapons to protect us from corona there are times when masks cause inconvenience one feels like removing them from the face especially during a conversation when a mask is required the most we tend to remove it at such times i urge you that whenever you feel your mask is bothersome and you want to remove it spare a thought for those doctors those nurses think of our corona warriors you will find them wearing masks for hours together diligently working to save our lives sometimes wearing masks for a span of eight to ten hours doesn t that discomfort them just think about them you too will feel that as citizens we should not be negligent at all nor let others be so on the one hand we have to fight the battle against corona with full awareness vigilance on the other whatever our responsibilities through sheer perseverance business jobs or studies we have to lend pace to it taking it to greater heights friends during the corona times our rural regions came up as a beacon of guidance for the entire country many examples of effective endeavours on part of local residents of villages gram panchayats are coming to the fore in jammu there is a gram panchayat named gram treva the sarpanch there is balbir kaur ji i am told that balbir kaur ji got a 30 bed quarantine centre constructed in her panchayat she also made arrangements for availability of water on roads leading to the panchayat she ensured that people did not have to face any problem in washing hands not just that balbir kaur ji with a spray pump slung on her shoulder embarks upon sanitization of the entire panchayat its neighbourhood along with volunteers similarly there is a kashmiri woman sarpanch zaitoona begum ji of chauntliwaar gaanderbal zaitoona begum ji decided that her panchayat would fight the battle against corona and along with that create income opportunities too she distributed free masks free ration in the vicinity at the same time she distributed crop seeds apple saplings so that people were not subjected to inconvenience in farming horticulture friends there is another inspiring example from kashmir shriman mohd iqbal is the municipal president of anantnag he required a sprayer for sanitization of his area he was informed that the machine would have to be brought from another town that too at a cost of six lakh rupees on this shriman iqbal ji through his own efforts designed made a sprayer machine and that too at a cost of fifty thousand rupees there are many similar examples such inspiring examples are emerging in the entire country from all corners everyday all of these are worthy of accolades challenges did come but people rose up to them with singular fortitude my dear countrymen the correct approach a positive approach always goes a long way in transforming distressing times into opportunities adversities into triggers of development progress in the present times of corona we have witnessed how the youth women of our country have come up with new experiments on the basis of their talent skills in bihar many women self help groups have begun making masks with madhubani motifs by and by they turned out to be very popular these madhubani masks in a way propagate a regional tradition besides protecting health they also create opportunities for livelihood you surely know of bamboo which grows abundantly in the north east now using the same bamboo artisans of tripura manipur and assam have started crafting high quality water bottles and tiffin boxes if you glance at the craftsmanship of these bottles you will not believe that bamboo can be used to create such fine products moreover these bottles are eco friendly before actually making them the bamboo is first boiled adding neem and other medicinal shrubs thus these bottles also acquire medicinal value an example from jharkhand shows us how small local products can be hugely successful in bishunpur jharkhand more than thirty groups are collectively cultivating lemongrass it takes four months for lemongrass to mature and its oil fetches a decent price in the market these days this product is much in demand i also wish to refer to two regions of the country both are hundreds of kilometers apart yet are contributing in making india self reliant in their own unique novel ways one is ladakh the other is kutch the mere mention of leh ladakh creates images of picturesque valleys mountain heights whiffs of fresh air on the other hand reference to kutch draws images of an unending desert with no vegetation in sight in ladakh a distinct fruit called chooli or apricot also known as khubani is grown this produce has the capacity to transform the economy of the area but unfortunately vagaries of supply chains weather are some of the formidable challenges it keeps facing to reduce spoilage to the minimum a new innovation has been adopted for use this is a dual system called solar apricot dryer space heater this desiccates apricots other fruits vegetables as per requirement that too in a hygienic manner earlier when apricots used to be dried in the vicinity of farms there would be spoilage besides loss of quality of fruit on account of dust rainwater on the other side these days farmers of kutch are making commendable efforts in the cultivation of dragon fruit many people are perplexed when they hear kutch dragon fruit together but today many farmers there have taken to this activity many innovations are taking place for enhancing fruit quality productivity yield i have been told that the popularity of dragon fruits is constantly increasing especially usage in breakfast has increased considerably the farmers of kutch have resolved that the country should not import dragon fruit and this is what self reliance is all about friends when we think of doing something new think innovatively then even such tasks become possible which in general no one imagines as exemplified by some youth of bihar earlier they used to do routine jobs one day they decided to start cultivating pearls in their area people did not know much about this but this group of people first gathered all the requisite information went to jaipur and bhubaneswar and took training and started cultivating pearls in their village today they are not just earning a lot from this activity but have also started training the migrant labourers returning from other states at muzaffarpur begusarai and patna and for many people this has opened the avenues to self reliance friends a few days from now the auspicious festival of rakshabandhan will be celebrated these days i am noticing that many people and institutions are campaigning to celebrate rakshabandhan this time in a different manner and many people are linking the festival with vocal for local and this is true too in society if the business of a person near our home increases on account of our festivals and thus in turn his festival becomes merrier then the joy of the festival increases manifold many felicitations to all the countrymen on rakshabandhan friends the 7th of august is national handloom day the handloom of india and our handicrafts encompass a glorious history of hundreds of years it should be an endeavour on part of all of us to use indian handloom and handicrafts as much as possible and also communicate to more and more people about them the more the world knows about the richness and diversity of indian handloom and handicrafts the greater our local artisans and weavers will benefit friends especially my young friends our country is changing how is she changing how fast is she changing in what all fields is she undergoing change if we look at it with a positive point of view we ourselves will be astounded there was a time when whether in sports or other sectors most people were either from big cities or from famous families or from well known schools or colleges now the country is changing our youth are coming forward from villages from small towns and from ordinary families new heights of success are being scaled these people are moving forward in the midst of crises fostering new dreams we see something similar to this in the

26-Jun-16,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on June 26, 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed his hopes for ample rainfall during the monsoon season and celebrated the achievements of Indian scientists, including students who built satellites launched by ISRO. He also praised the success of the ""Save the Girl Child, Educate the Girl Child"" campaign and highlighted the induction of India's first batch of women fighter pilots in the Indian Air Force. The Prime Minister emphasized the significance of yoga and the International Yoga Day celebration worldwide, calling for the global promotion of yoga and the fight against diabetes through yogic practices. He appealed to citizens to voluntarily declare undisclosed income and assets by September 30, 2016, to avoid potential troubles later, encouraging a culture of trust in taxation. The address concluded with an anecdote of a citizen who donated a significant portion of his pension for the Cleanliness Campaign and a call for water conservation. Narendra Modi also mentioned the accessibility of his radio show through the number 1922, allowing people to listen in their preferred language and participate in the nation's progress.",26-jun-2016 my dear countrymen my greetings namaskar to you all last year we had to endure so many trials the scorching heat of the summer scarcity of water drought conditions and so on however the past two weeks have been the harbinger of the welcome news of rainfall from different places bringing in its wake a feeling of freshness you too must have felt it going by the predictions of the scientists this time there should be good rainfall far and wide and throughout the rainy season this news in itself charges us with a lot of enthusiasm i extend my greetings to all our farmer brethren hoping for a bountiful rainfall in our country like the toiling farmers our scientists are also achieving success on many fronts to take our country to new heights i have believed it right from the beginning that the new generation should nurture the dream of becoming scientists should have keen interest in science and our youngsters should step forward with the zeal to do something for the coming generations i also want to share another bright news with you yesterday i had gone to pune on the occasion of the anniversary of the smart city project over there i met those students of the pune college of engineering who on their own have made a satellite which was launched on 22nd june i had called them to meet me as i had a wish to see these young friends of mine to interact with them and to experience firsthand the energy and enthusiasm within them for the past many years several students have made their contributions to this project in a way this academic satellite is a living example of the soaring flight of courage and ambition of the young india that has led these our students to make this satellite the dreams behind this small satellite are big and lofty they soar high into the sky the efforts put in by them are very intense on similar lines as achieved by these pune students the students of satyabhama university of chennai in tamil nadu also created their satellite and their sathyabamasat has also been launched we have been hearing these things since childhood and every child wishes deep inside his heart to touch the sky and grab a few stars keeping this in mind in my opinion these two satellites made by the students and launched by isro are extremely important and most valuable all these students deserve hearty congratulations i also want to congratulate the people of the country that on 22nd june our scientists at isro launched 20 satellites simultaneously into space and in the process set a new record breaking their own previous records and this is also a matter of joy that of the twenty satellites which were launched in india 17 satellites were from other countries along with america the satellites of many other countries were launched on indian soil by indian scientists and along with these those two satellites made by our students also reached outer space and it is also noteworthy that owing to its guarantee of success with lesser cost isro has carved its special place in the world and for this very reason many countries of the world are today looking towards india for the launching of their satellites my dear countrymen save the girl child educate the girl child beti bachao beti padhao has already become the mann ki baat the heartfelt wish of all the people of india still some incidents infuse a new life into this slogan this time in the results of 10th and 12th classes our daughters have been doing wonderfully well which is a matter of pride and my dear countrymen there is another significant event that all of us should take pride in on 18th june the indian air force for the very first time inducted its first batch of women fighter pilots you get goose pimples just at the mention of women fighter pilots we feel so proud that these three flying officer daughters of ours avni chaturvedi bhawna kanth and mohana have achieved this great feat what these three daughters have accomplished is truly special flying officer avni is from rewa in madhya pradesh flying officer bhawana is from begusarai in bihar and flying officer mohana is from vadodara in gujarat you must have noticed that all these three daughters do not hail from metro cities of india they do not even come from the capital cities of their respective states despite hailing from small cities and towns they nurtured dreams as high as the sky and they also made them come true i extend my heartiest wishes to these three daughters avni bhawana and mohana as well as their parents my dear countrymen a few days ago on 21st june the whole world organised grand shows in observance of the anniversary of the international day for yoga as an indian when we witness the entire world coming together through yoga we realize that the entire world is getting linked with our past present and future we are forging a unique bond with the rest of the world in india too the international yoga day was celebrated at over 1 lakh places with a lot of fervour and enthusiasm in myriad forms and hues and in an atmosphere of gaiety i also got an opportunity to perform yoga in chandigarh amidst thousands of yoga lovers it was worth watching the zeal of the young and old alike you must have seen that last week the indian government issued a postage stamp on surya namaskar on the occasion of international yoga day this time people all over the world on yoga day were witness to two special events one was at new york city where the united nations organisation uno head quarters building is located a special projection depicting different postures of the various yoga asanas was organized on top of that building and passersby kept taking pictures of these and these pictures soon were being shared all over the world tell me which indian would not feel proud at such happenings one more interesting thing happened technology is at work social media has created an identity of its own and this time twitter carried out a light hearted pleasant experiment in yoga with its yoga imaging as soon as we typed hash tag yoga day we would immediately get a picture of a yoga image on our mobile and this image too went viral all over the world yoga by itself means adding getting connected yoga has the power to connect the entire world but for that to happen first all of us need to get connected to yoga swati srivastava from satna in madhya pradesh called me up on telephone after the yoga day and left a message for all of you but it seems that it pertains more to me sound byte i wish that my entire country should be healthy and all the poor people also should remain free from diseases for this i want that among the many ads that are played on doordarshan there should be one ad on yoga how it is to be done and what are its benefits swati ji your suggestion is very good but if you observe carefully you will notice that not just on doordarshan but these days in india and outside india too the indian t v channels and channels of other countries are pitching in with their contribution to propagate yoga they all are shown at different times but if you watch carefully all these things are being done to disseminate information about yoga and i have seen that there are some countries in the world which have t v channels exclusively dedicated to yoga 24 hours a day and you probably know that during the month of june in view of the international yoga day i used to share a video everyday of one particular asana of yoga through twitter and face book if you go to the website of the ministry of ayush you will see available there a 40 45 minutes very good video demonstrating one after another different kinds of yog asanas for different parts of the body that you can do people of all ages can do to you and through you to all the people interested in yoga i would like to exhort to get connected to it this time i have made an appeal when we say that yoga is a way to rid oneself of illnesses then why don t we bring together all the different schools of thought of yoga which have their own methods their own priorities and their own experiences but all of them share the same final goal all the prevalent systems of yoga all the functioning yoga institutions all the different yoga gurus i have urged all of them to run a successful campaign this entire year on how to defeat diabetes through yoga can we control diabetes through yoga some people have been successful in that everyone has searched for a wayin this regard and we know that there is no definite cure for diabetes one has to manage it with medicines diabetes is the master switch that triggers all other illnesses it becomes an entrance for many other diseases and so everyone is wary of diabetes a lot of people have worked in this direction some diabetic patients have also been able to control it thorough their yogic practice why don t we share our experiences with other people to impart a momentum to this endeavour and create a kind of atmosphere for it for an entire year i urge you to use hashtag yoga fights diabetes i repeat hashtag yoga fights diabetes use this twitter handle and share your experiences on social media or send them to me on narendramodiapp let us see what the various experiences are at least give it a try i invite you to share your experiences on hashtag yoga fights diabetes my dear countrymen sometimes my mann ki baat is ridiculed a lot and is criticized much also however this can only happen because all of us are committed to democracy but today as i speak to you on 26th june and i want to especially say this to the new generation that this democracy that we take pride in this democracy that has granted great power to us every citizen has been empowered but 26th june 1975 was also a day the night of 25th june and the next morning was a dark hour for the democracy of india when emergency was imposed in india all the rights of the citizens were suspended the country was turned into a prison lakhs of people along with jai prakash narain thousands of leaders many organisations were put behind bars many books have been written on that dark period many discussions have been held on it but today as i talk to you all on 26th june we should not forget that our strength lies in our democracy our strength lies in the people s power our strength lies in each and every citizen of our country we have to carry forward this commitment and make it stronger and it is this people s power which has sustained democracy as its living embodiment there might have been locks on newspaper houses radio might have been speaking just one kind of language still on the other hand given the opportune moment the citizens give an example of the power of democracy a great example of the democratic strength of the common people was witnessed during emergency and we must keep reminding our country of its democratic strength from time to time and our endeavour should be to make people aware of their power and to always have the tendency to further strengthen it by linking more and more people to it i always stress that democracy doesn t merely mean that people vote for you and give you the contract to run this country for five years certainly not voting is certainly an important component but there are many other facets of democracy and the biggest dimension is that of people s participation their attitude their thinking and the more the governments get connected with the people the stronger they become the chasm between the governments and the people leads to ruin my endeavour has always been to ensure that the nation moves forward on the strength of people s participation recently when my government completed two years of functioning some young people of modern thinking suggested when you talk such big things about democracy then why don t you get your government rated by the people also in a way it had a tone of challenge as well as advice but that stirred my mind i raised this topic with some of my senior colleagues their first reaction was oh no sir what are you thinking of doing these days technology has changed so much that if people get together and form a group and if they decide to misuse technology then who knows in which direction they might take forward this survey they thus expressed their concern but i felt no we should go ahead even if it is a risk we should give it a try and see what happens now a lot of surveys are conducted after the elections during the elections at other times also over some issues sometimes to gauge the popularity but the sample size of these surveys is not very big however my dear countrymen i am happy to state that when i through the medium of technology using different languages appealed to the masses to rate my government a lot of people amongst you have expressed your opinion on rate my government mygov in lakhs of you displayed your interest in this but 3 lakh people devoted their time and put in serious effort for giving an answer to each and every question i am grateful to these 3 lakh people that they displayed a lot of self initiative in rating the government i won t discuss the results our media persons are sure to do that but i can say for sure that it was a good experiment and this was a matter of joy for me that people speaking all the languages of india residing in every corner of the country hailing from all types of background all of them participated in it and the biggest thing was and this of course came as a surprise to me that maximum number of people took part in this exercise through the portal of the website of the rural employment scheme which is being run by the government thus my primary impression is that there has been a large and active participation of people connected to rural india and poverty issues this i liked the most so you have seen that while on 26th june some years ago the voice of the people was stifled now is the time when the people make their decisions they judge whether the government is doing the right thing or not is performing well or poorly this is the real power of democracy my dear countrymen today i want to make a special appeal for one thing there was a time when taxes were so pervasive that it became a habit to avoid taxation there was a time when there were many restrictions imposed on bringing foreign goods into the country which gave rise to a lot of smuggling but gradually times have changed now it is not very difficult for the taxpayer to get connected with the taxation system of the government but even then old habits die hard one generation still feels that it is best to keep away from the government today i want to impress upon you that we end up losing our peace of mind by trying to escape from rules and regulations as a result anybody can trouble and harass us why should we let this happen why don t we on our own give the correct details of our income and property to the government so that we can rid ourselves from the burden of hitherto undeclared assets i appeal to the countrymen to do this to the people who have undisclosed income the government of india has given a chance to declare such income the government has presented before the country a special facility to disclose undisclosed income by the 30th of september we can be free ourselves of various burdens just by paying a fine i have also promised that for those who voluntarily declare to the government their assets and their undisclosed income then the government will not conduct any kind of enquiry not once will it be asked as to from where all this wealth came and how it was acquired and so this is a good chance for you to become a part of a transparent system at the same time i want to tell the people of the country that please consider this plan which is up to 30th september as your last chance in between i had even told the members of the parliament that after 30th september if any citizen is put through any difficulty the one who does not want to follow due rules of government then it will not be possible to help them i want to say this to the people of the country that we do not wish that after the 30th september anything should happen that will cause difficulties for you and so i say that please avail of this facility before this date and save yourselves from any possible trouble after the 30th of september my dear countrymen i had to talk about this in mann ki baat today because recently i held a two day conclave with the revenue departments all the officials of the income tax customs and excise departments and i have told them in clear words that we should not perceive citizens as crooks we should have trust and faith in the citizens we should hold hands with them if they want to follow rules we should encourage them and lovingly help them cross over it is important to build an atmosphere of trust we shall have to bring about a change through our conduct we shall have to reassure the taxpayer i stressed this upon them and i noticed that they too realized that today when the nation is surging ahead all of us must contribute to it and when i was taking inputs from them in this conclave i gathered information which i want to share with you as well none of you will believe that in a country of 125 crore people one and a half only one and a half lakh people exist whose taxable income is more than 50 lakh rupees nobody will be able to swallow something like this people having a taxable income of more than 50 lakh rupees can be seen in big cities in large numbers just looking at their bungalows worth 1 or 2 crores one wonders how they can be in a tax bracket of less than 50 lakhs this means that there is something wrong somewhere we have to change this situation and this has to change before 30th september before taking any extreme steps the government must give a chance to the people and so my dear brothers and sisters this is a golden chance for you to disclose your undisclosed income and in another way this is the way out to save yourself from any trouble that could arise after 30th september i urge you to come forth in this task for the betterment of our country for the upliftment of the poor and i do not want that you should face any problems after 30th september my dear countrymen the common man of this country is always looking for a chance to do something for the country when i asked the people to give up their cooking gas subsidy more than 1 crore families of this country voluntarily gave up their subsidy and now i want to cite an example especially for those people who have undisclosed income yesterday when i went to pune for the smart city programme over there i got the chance to meet shri chandrakant damodar kulkarni and his family i had called them especially to meet me and what was the reason anyone who has ever evaded tax my words may or may not inspire that person but the example of shri chandrakant kulkarni is sure to inspire him do you know what the reason is shri chandrakant kulkarni is an ordinary man who belongs to an average middle class family he used to work for the government then he retired he receives a pension of sixteen thousand rupees and my dear countrymen you will be surprised to hear and those who are in the habit of evading tax will get a shock to know that chandrakant kulkarni ji who gets a pension of only rupees sixteen thousand some time back wrote a letter to me saying that out of his pension of 16 000 he voluntarily wants to donate rs 5000 per month for the cleanliness campaign and not just this he sent me 52 cheques post dated which bear a date for each forthcoming month we certainly do not have any right to evade tax in this country where there is one such government employee who after retirement out of a pension of mere sixteen thousand rupees gives five thousand for the cleanliness campaign no one could be a greater source of inspiration than chandrakant kulkarni and for the people who are associated with the cleanliness campaign also there could be no better inspiring example than chandrakant kulkarni i called chandrakantji face to face i met him and his life has touched my heart i express my felicitations and admiration for the kulkarni family i congratulate them and surely there must be countless people like them about whom i have no information these are the very people and this is the power and strength of the masses a man with a pension of sixteen thousand rupees sends me cheques worth two lakhs sixty thousand in advance is this a small thing come let us search deep down inside our hearts and ponder over the fact that the government has given us an opportunity to disclose our incomes while thinking of chandrkant kulkarni let us also follow him my dear countrymen santosh negi from pauri garhwal in uttarakhand has called up to relate one of his experiences he has given a message regarding water conservation friends his experience can be of use to you as well sound byte drawing inspiration from you in our school before the onset of monsoon we dug 250 small trenches which were 4 feet deep along the side of the playground so that rainwater could be collected in these this way the play ground remained unspoilt and there was no danger of children drowning in these and we managed to save crores of litres of rainwater which fell on the playfield santoshji i would like to thank you for sending me this message pauri garhwal is a hilly area where you have done such splendid work you deserve congratulations for that the people of our country should certainly enjoy the rains but let us also be mindful that this is a holy gift from the almighty this is a limitless wealth we should make every effort to conserve every single drop of water how can we retain the rainwater of the villages there itself and similarly preserve rainwater of cities therein to recharge mother earth once again how can we replenish water back to the earth if there is water today only then can there be a tomorrow water is the basis of all life an atmosphere has certainly been created in the country lately in all the states a lot of measures have been taken for water conservation but now that we are going to have the bounty of rain water we must see to it that it doesn t just flow away we are so concerned about saving lives we should be equally concerned about saving water my dear countrymen you already know that number 1922 it must have become a part of your memory by now 1 9 2 2 this 1922 is one such number that if you give a missed call to it you can listen to mann ki baat in the language of your choice by listening to mann ki baat at the time of your convenience in the language of your choice you too can make up your mind and resolve to contribute to the journey of the nation s progress my namaskar once again to all my countrymen thank you for the last few weeks we have got positive news about rainfall in various parts of

26-Jun-22,"In the June 2022 episode of ""Mann Ki Baat,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed various topics.

He urged people to stay healthy and alert during the monsoon season, and expressed gratitude to the citizens.",26-jun-2022 hello my dear countrymen namaskar i have received many letters from all of you for mann ki baat i have also received many messages on social media and namoapp i am very thankful to you for that in this program it is our endeavour to discuss each other s inspiring efforts to tell the story of change through mass movement to the entire country in this episode i want to discuss with you today one such mass movement of the country that holds great importance in the life of every citizen of the country but before that i want to ask a question to the youth of today s generation to the youth in the age group of 24 25 years and the question is very serious do ponder my question over did you know that when your parents were your age once even their right to life was snatched away from them you must be thinking how could have this happened this is just impossible but my young friends this had happened once in our country this took place years ago in 1975 it was the month of june when emergency was imposed in that all the rights were taken away from the citizens of the country one amongst those rights was the right to life and personal liberty provided to all indians under article 21 of the constitution at that time an attempt was made to crush the democracy of india the country s courts every constitutional institution the press were put under control the condition of censorship was such that nothing could be printed without approval i remember when famous singer kishore kumar refused to applaud the government he was banned his entry on the radio was done away with but even after many attempts thousands of arrests and atrocities on lakhs of people the faith of the people of india in democracy did not shake not at all for us the people of india the sanskars of democracy which we have been carrying on for centuries the democratic spirit which is in our veins finally won the people of india got rid of the emergency and re established democracy in a democratic way it is difficult to find such an example of defeating a dictatorial mindset a dictatorial tendency in a democratic way in the whole world during the emergency i had the good fortune to have been a witness to be a partner in the struggle of the countrymen as a soldier of democracy today when the country is celebrating 75 years of its independence celebrating amrit mahotsav we should never forget that dreadful period of emergency the generations to come should also not forget the amrit mahotsav not only encompasses the victory saga of freedom from hundreds of years of slavery but also the journey of 75 years after independence we move forward learning from every important stage of history my dear countrymen there is hardly any of us who in one s life has not had fantasies pertaining to the sky during one s childhood stories of the moon and stars in the sky attract everyone for the youth touching the sky is synonymous with making dreams come true today when our india is touching the sky of success in so many fields how can the skies or space remain untouched by it in the past few years many big feats related to the space sector have been accomplished in our country one of these achievements of the country has been the creation of an agency named in space an agency that is promoting new opportunities in the space sector for the private sector of india this beginning has especially attracted the youth of our country i have received messages related to this from many young people a few days ago when i had gone to dedicate to the people the headquarters of in space i saw the ideas and enthusiasm of many young start ups i also talked to them for a long time you too will not be able to help being surprised when you learn about them for example take just the number and speed of space start ups till a few years ago in our country in the space sector no one even thought about start ups today their number is more than a hundred all these start ups are working on ideas which were either not thought about earlier or were considered impossible for the private sector for example chennai and hyderabad have two start ups agnikul and skyroot these start ups are developing launch vehicles that will take small payloads into space through this the cost of space launching is estimated to come down significantly similarly dhruva space another start up of hyderabad is working on high technology solar panels for satellite deployer and satellites i also met tanveer ahmed of digantara another space start up who is trying to map waste in space i have also given him a challenge that they should evolve work technology which can solve the problem of waste in space both digantara and dhruva space are going to make their first launch from isro s launch vehicle on the 30th of june similarly neha the founder of astrome a space start up based in bangalore is also working on an amazing idea this start up is making such flat antennas which will not only be small but their cost will also be very low demand for this technology can be all over the world friends in the program of in space i also met beti tanvi patel a school student of mehsana she is working on a very small satellite which is going to be launched in space in the next few months tanvi told me about her work very simply in gujarati like tanvi about seven hundred and fifty school students in the country are working on 75 such satellites in the amrit mahotsav and it is also a matter of joy that most of these students are from small towns of the country friends these are the same youth in whose mind the image of the space sector was like a secret mission a few years ago but the country undertook space reforms and the same youth are now launching their own satellites when the youth of the country is ready to touch the sky how can our country be left behind my dear countrymen in mann ki baat let s now talk about a topic that will delight your mind and inspire you as well recently our olympic gold medalist neeraj chopra was again in the headlines even after the olympics he is setting new records of success one after the other neeraj won the silver at paavo nurmi games in finland not only that he also broke the record of his own javelin throw neeraj once again made the country proud by winning the gold in kuortane games he won this gold in conditions when the weather there was also inclement this zest is the hallmark of today s youth from start ups to the sports world the youth of india are making new records in the recently held khelo india youth games too our players set many records you would love to know that a total of 12 records have been broken in these games not only that 11 records have been registered in the names of female players m martina devi of manipur has made eight records in weightlifting similarly sanjana sonakshi and bhavna have also made different records with their hard work these players have proven how much india s prestige is going to rise in international sports arena in the coming times i also congratulate all these players and wish them all the best for the future friends there has been another special feature of khelo india youth games this time too many such talents have emerged who are from very ordinary families these players have struggled a lot in their lives to reach this stage of success in their success their family and parents too have had a big role to play father of adil altaf from srinagar who won the gold in 70 km cycling does tailoring work but has left no stone unturned to fulfill his son s dreams today adil has brought pride to his father and the entire jammu

rohtak by winning the gold medal in wrestling tanu has realized her own her family s and her father s dream friends in the sports world now the dominance of indian players is increasing at the same time a new image of indian sports is also emerging for example in khelo india youth games besides disciplines that are in olympics five indigenous sports were also included this time these five sports are gatka thang ta yogasan kalaripayattu and mallakhamb friends there is going to be an international tournament of a game which was born centuries ago in our own country in india this is the event of

poorna is the same daughter of india who had accomplished the amazing feat of done a conquering mount everest at the age of just 13 friends when it comes to sports today i would also like to discuss mithali raj one of the most talented cricketers in india just this month she has announced her retirement from cricket which has emotionally moved many sports lovers mithali has not only been an extraordinary player but has also been an inspiration to many players i wish mithali all the very best for her future my dear countrymen in mann ki baat we have been discussing the successful efforts related to waste to wealth one such example is that of aizwal the capital of mizoram there is a beautiful river chitte lui in aizwal which due to neglect for years had turned into a heap of dirt and garbage efforts have started in the last few years to save this river for this local agencies voluntary organizations and local people together are also running the save chitte lui action plan this campaign of cleaning the river has also made an opportunity for wealth creation from waste actually this river and its banks were full of plastic and polythene waste the organization working to save the river decided to build a road using this polythene that is the waste that came out of the river from that in a village in mizoram the state s first plastic road was built that is cleanliness and development as well friends one such effort has also been undertaken by the youth of puducherry through their voluntary organizations puducherry is situated along the sea coast a large number of people come to see the beaches and marine beauty there but the pollution caused by plastic was also increasing on the sea coast of puducherry therefore to save its sea beaches and ecology people here have started the recycling for life campaign today thousands of kilograms of garbage is collected and segregated every day in karaikal puducherry the organic waste from that is made into compost the rest of the matter is separated and recycled such efforts are not only inspiring but also lend momentum to india s campaign against single use plastic friends at this time when i am talking to you a unique cycling rally is also going on in himachal pradesh i want to tell you about this too a group of cyclists have started from shimla to mandi carrying the message of cleanliness these people will complete this distance of about one hundred and seventy five kilometers on mountain roads only by cycling there are children as well as the elderly in this group if our environment is clean our mountains and rivers our seas remain clean our health also gets better you must keep writing me about such efforts my dear countrymen monsoon is continuously progressing in our country rain is increasing in many states this is also the time to make special efforts in the direction of water and water conservation in our country for centuries this responsibility has been taken by the society together you will remember in mann ki baat we once discussed the legacy of step wells the baolis are those big wells which are reached by descending stairs in udaipur rajasthan there is one such stepwell which is hundreds of years old sultan ki baoli it was built by rao sultan singh but due to neglect gradually this place has become deserted and has turned into a pile of garbage one day some youths roaming around reached this stepwell and were very sad to see its condition at that very moment these youths resolved to change the picture and destiny of sultan ki baoli they named this mission of their sultan se sur tan you must be wondering what is this sur tan in fact with their efforts these youths have not only rejuvenated the step well but have also linked it to the notes and melody of the music after cleaning the sultan s stepwell after decorating it takes place a program of harmony and music there is so much talk of this change that many people from abroad have started coming to see it the most important thing about this successful effort is that the youth who started the campaign are chartered accountants coincidentally a few days from now july 1 is observed as chartered accountants day i congratulate all the cas of the country in advance we can create a similar sense of awareness about our water bodies by connecting them with music and other social programs water conservation is actually life conservation you must have seen nowadays how many river festivals are being held whichever water sources are there in your cities you must organize one event or the other my dear countrymen our upanishads mention about a life mantra charaiveti charaiveti charaiveti you must have heard this mantra too it means keep going keep going this mantra is so popular in our country because it is part of our nature to keep moving to be dynamic to keep moving as a nation we have come this far through a journey of development spanning thousands of years as a society we have always moved ahead by accepting new ideas new changes our cultural mobility and travels have contributed a lot in this that is why our sages and saints had entrusted us with spiritual responsibilities like pilgrimage all of us go on varied pilgrimages you must have seen that this time a large number of devotees participated in the chardham yatra in our country from time to time different dev yatras also take place dev yatras that is in which not only the devotees but also our gods go on a journey in just a few days from now on the 1st of july the famous journey of lord jagannath is going to commence all of us are familiar with the puri yatra in odisha people make efforts to ensure that on this occasion they get the good fortune of going to puri in other states too jagannath yatras are taken out with great gaiety and fervour bhagwan jagannath yatra begins on dwitiya the second day of the month of ashadha in our texts ashadhasya dwitiya divase rath yatra this is how the description is found in sanskrit shlokas in ahmedabad gujrat too every year rath yatra begins from ashadh dwitiya i was in gujarat so i also used to get the privilege of serving in this yatra every year ashadha dwitiya also known as ashadhi bij marks the beginning of the new year of kutch on this day i also wish happy new year to all my kutchi brothers and sisters for me this day is also very special i remember a day before ashadha dwitiya that is on the first tithi of ashadha we started a sanskrit festival in gujarat which comprises songs music and cultural programs in sanskrit language the name of this event is ashadhasya pratham diwase there is also a reason behind giving this special name to the festival actually the great sanskrit poet kalidas wrote the meghdootam on the arrival of rain from the month of ashadh there is a verse in meghdootam ashadhasya pratham diwase megham ashlishta sanum that is mountain peaks covered with clouds on the first day of ashadha this verse became the basis of this event friends be it ahmedabad or puri lord jagannath also gives us many deep human messages through this journey bhagwan jagannath is the lord of the world but the poor and downtrodden have a special participation in his journey god also walks along with every section and person of the society similarly in all the journeys that take place in our country there is no such distinction between poor and rich high and low rising above all discrimination the journey itself is paramount as you must have heard about the yatra of pandharpur in maharashtra in the pandharpur yatra one is neither big nor small everyone is a varkari a servant of bhagwan vitthal just 4 days later the amarnath yatra is also going to start from the 30th of june devotees from all over the country reach jammu kashmir for the amarnath yatra the local people of jammu kashmir take the responsibility of this yatra with equal reverence and cooperate with the pilgrims friends the sabarimala yatra has the same importance in the south this pilgrimage to seek darshan of bhagwan ayyappa on the hills of sabarimala has been going on from the times when this path was completely surrounded by forests even today when people go on these yatras how many opportunities are created for the poor from religious rituals to lodging arrangements that is these yatras directly give us an opportunity to serve the poor and are equally beneficial to them that is why the country too is now making many efforts to increase the facilities for the devotees in their spiritual journeys if you too go on such a journey you will also have a glance of ek bharat shreshtha bharat along with spirituality my dear countrymen as always this time also it was a very pleasant experience to connect with all of you through mann ki baat we discussed the successes and achievements of the countrymen in the midst of all this we also have to take precautions against corona however it is a matter of satisfaction that today the country has a comprehensive protective shield of a vaccine we have reached close to 200 crore vaccine doses precaution dose is also being rapidly administered in the country if it is time for a precaution dose after your second dose then you must take this third dose make your family members especially the elderly take a precautionary dose we also have to take necessary precautions like hand hygiene and masks we also have to be alert of the diseases caused by the surrounding filth during the rainy season all of you stay alert stay healthy and keep moving forward with similar positive energy we ll

26-Mar-17,"In his address on March 26, 2017, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi began by acknowledging the stress students face during exams and urged them to revisit his previous 'Mann Ki Baat' suggestions. He extended greetings to Bangladesh on its Independence Day, emphasizing India's partnership and commitment to regional peace and development. The speech then turned to the shared heritage of Rabindranath Tagore and his role in inspiring a young Bhagat Singh during the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

The speech concluded with greetings for various regional New Year celebrations, highlighting India's rich cultural diversity and unity.",26-mar-2017 my dear countrymen namaskar parents in most parts of the country must be busy with their children s examinations there would be a sense of relief where the examinations are over but where the examinations are still on there certainly would still be some amount of pressure however at a time like this i would only say that students may listen again to what i had said in my mann ki baat last time i am sure that my suggestions there will be of substantial help while they sit for their examinations today is the 26th of march 26th march is the independence day of bangladesh it was a historic war against injustice which was fought under the leadership of banga bandhu and led to the unprecedented victory of the people of bangladesh i extend my heartfelt greetings to the brothers and sisters of bangladesh on this significant day and i hope that bangladesh marches ahead on the path of progress i also assure the citizens of bangladesh that india is a strong partner and a good friend and we will continue to work together shoulder to shoulder to contribute towards the peace security and development of this entire region it is a matter of great pride for all of us that rabindranath tagore and his memories are a shared heritage the national anthem of bangladesh too has been composed by gurudev rabindranath tagore there is a very interesting fact about gurudev that in 1913 he was not only the first asian to receive the nobel prize but knighthood was also conferred upon him by the british after the jallianwallah massacre by the british in 1919 rabindranath tagore was one of the legendary figures who raised their voices in protest and it was at the same time that this event left a very deep impact on a twelve year old boy the inhuman massacre at jallianwalla bagh provided a new inspiration and mission in life to that young teenager who until then had spent his days playing merrily in his fields and bhagat that 12 year old boy in 1919 evolved to be the martyr bhagat singh our dear hero and inspiration on the 23rd of march bhagat singh ji and his comrades sukhdev and rajguru were hanged to death by the british and we are all aware of that there was a sense of fulfillment on the faces of bhagat singh sukhdev and rajguru for having served mother india there was no fear of death they had sublimated all their dreams for the freedom of mother india these three heroes inspire us to this day it would be impossible to express in words the story of the supreme sacrifice of bhagat singh sukhdev and rajguru and the entire british empire feared these three young men they were in jail certain to be hanged but still the british remained anxious about how to deal with them that is why though the scheduled date was the 24th they were hanged on the 23rd of march this was done clandestinely which is not the usual practice and later their remains were brought to present day punjab and were secretly cremated many years ago when i first got the chance to go there i could feel a certain vibration in that place and i would certainly urge the youth of our country to go to punjab whenever they get the chance and visit the samadhi of bhagat singh sukhdev rajguru bhagat singh s mother and batukeshwar dutt that was the period when the desire for freedom its intensity and spread were on the rise on the one hand brave hearts like bhagat singh sukhdev and rajguru were inspiring the youth towards an armed revolution and on the other hand exactly one hundred years ago on the 10th of april 1917 mahatma gandhi had launched the champaran satyagraha this year marks the centenary of the champaran satyagraha in india s struggle for freedom gandhian thought and gandhian practice became manifest for the first time in champaran this was a turning point in the entire journey of india s freedom struggle especially in the context of the methodology of the struggle this was the period when in the champaran satyagraha kheda satyagraha and the mill workers strike in ahmedabad the deep impact of mahatma gandhi s thoughts and practices was amply and clearly visible gandhi returned to india in 1915 and in 1917 he went to a small village in bihar and gave the country a new inspiration we cannot evaluate the champaran satyagraha on the basis of the image of mahatma gandhi that we cherish in our hearts today just imagine that one man who came to india in 1915 and had been in the country for barely two years the country didn t know of him he bore no influence then it was just the beginning we can only imagine the hardships that he must have endured how hard he must have had to toil and it was the champaran satyagraha that brought to the fore mahatma gandhi s organisational skills and his strong ability to gauge the pulse of indian society mahatma gandhi through his demeanour and deeds could inspire the poorest of the poor the most illiterate to unite and come together out into the open for the struggle against the british rule this was a manifestation of an incredible inner strength through which we can experience the vastness of mahatma gandhi s great persona but if we reflect upon the gandhi of a hundred years ago the gandhi of the champaran satyagraha that would be a subject of deep study for anyone about to enter public life we can all learn from gandhi ji what it means to begin a life of public service how hard one has to work as gandhi did and that was the period when all the stalwarts that we hear about today rajendra babu acharya kripalani ji and others were all sent to the villages by gandhi ji ways and means to connect with the people and lending hues of freedom to their day to day work were taught and the british were simply unable to comprehend gandhi ji s unique style of working which encompassed both struggle and creation together in a way gandhi created two sides of the same coin one being struggle and the other creativity to get themselves arrested voluntarily to fill jails on the one hand and on the other to immerse themselves in creative work gandhi s style of working had an incredible balance what the word satyagraha means what disagreement can mean what non cooperation in the face of such a vast empire could be gandhi ji established a completely new vision of resistance not through mere words but through a successful experiment today as the nation observes the centenary of the champaran satyagraha the immense power of the common man so visible in the struggle for freedom manifests again in the journey from swaraj to suraaj the resolve the perseverance of the 125 crore countrymen following the tenet of sarvyajan hitaay sarvajan sukhaay i e for the benefit of all for the happiness of all and the ceaseless enterprise to achieve something for the country the society would bring about the realisation of the dreams of the great souls who laid down their lives for the sake of freedom today as we live in the 21st century which indian wouldn t want to see india change which indian wouldn t want to be a partner in the transformation of the country this desire of 125 crore countrymen for change the effort to change is what will lay a strong foundation of a new india new india is neither a government programme nor is it the manifesto of a political party nor is it a project new india is the clarion call of 125 crore countrymen it is the essence of the emotions of the 125 crore indians wanting to come together and create a magnificent india 125 crore indians nurture a hope a zeal a resolve a desire my dear countrymen if we for a moment pause to look with empathy at the happenings in society around us and if we try to understand these we would be amazed to see that there are lakhs of people who besides their own personal responsibilities are working selflessly for society the exploited victimised deprived for the poor and the oppressed that too silently and with devotion as if they are performing tapasya or sadhana there are many who regularly go to hospitals to serve patients there are many who rush to donate blood when required there are many who try to provide food to the hungry our country is a many splendoured land the belief that service to humanity is service to god is innate to us if we look at it in its collectiveness in an organised manner it comes across as a major force when there is a talk of new india its criticism its analysis it counter views are but natural and that is a fundamental of democracy but it is true that if 125 crore countrymen resolve and decide to walk step by step on a path to realise that resolve the dream of new india can be fulfilled in our lifetime and all these things are not necessarily achieved through the budget government projects or government money if every citizen resolves to obey traffic rules if every citizen resolves that he will discharge his duties honestly if every citizen resolves that he will not use petrol or diesel one day in a week these are not very big things but these will contribute to the realisation of the dream of this country this new india that is being nurtured by 125 crore countrymen and this realisation will be achieved before their eyes in essence every citizen must discharge his civic duties and responsibilities this in itself would be a good beginning to the new india as india gets ready to celebrate 75 years of independence in 2022 come let us remember bhagat singh sukhdev rajguru let us remember the champaran satyagraha why don t we too be a part of this journey from swaraj to suraaj by making our lives disciplined and filled with resolve come i invite you my dear countrymen today i want to express my gratitude to all of you over the last few months the country has witnessed a certain atmosphere in which people in large numbers have participated in the digital payment digidhan movement there has also been an increase in curiosity about cashless transactions the poorest of the poor are making an attempt to learn and people are gradually moving towards doing businesses without cash there has been a surge in various modes of digital payment after demonetisation the bhim app was launched just about two to two and a half months ago but approximately one and half crore people have downloaded it my dear countrymen we must take our fight against black money and corruption to the next level can 125 crore countrymen resolve to undertake 2500 crores digital transactions during this year we have made an announcement in the budget our 125 crore countrymen if they wish to do so they need not wait for a year they can do it in six months 2500 crore digital transactions if we pay school fees we shall do so not by cash but digitally if we travel by train travel by air we shall pay digitally if buy medicines we shall pay digitally if we run fair price shops we will use the digital mode we can do this in our day to day lives you can t imagine how you can serve the country in this way and become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption recently several digidhan mela programmes were organised to educate the people and to increase public awareness the resolve was to organise 100 such programmes all over the country about 80 85 programmes have already been conducted there was also a reward scheme close to 12 and half lakh people have won prizes seventy thousand traders also won the prizes instituted for them each and every one of them also resolved to carry this mission forward the birth anniversary of dr baba saheb ambedkar is on the 14th of april and as was decided much earlier the digimela will be brought to a culmination on the 14th of april the birth anniversary of baba saheb ambedkar on the completion of a hundred days a grand closing ceremony will be held there is a provision of a bumper draw also in that i believe that in whatever time that is left before baba saheb ambedkar s birth anniversary we should popularise and promote the bhim app we should contribute towards ensuring reducing the use of cash of currency notes my dear countrymen i am glad that every time i request people for suggestions in mann ki baat numerous suggestions pour in but i have seen that there is always an emphasis on the topic of cleanliness gayatri a young girl from dehradun who is a student of class 11 has phoned in with a message esteemed principal prime minister sir my respectful greetings to you to begin with heartiest congratulations on your victory in the elections with a huge margin i wish to share the issue close to my heart with you i want to say that people will have to be made aware about the importance of cleanliness every day i pass by a river in which people dump a lot of garbage and pollute rivers the river flows under the rispana bridge before passing by my home for the sake of this river we went to settlements on its banks spoke to people and took out rallies too but to no avail i want to request you to kindly highlight this issue by sending a team there or through the newspapers thank you brothers and sisters look at the agony of this young daughter the 11th class student how enraged she is by seeing the river strewn with trash i consider this to be a good omen this is exactly what i want that 125 crore countrymen be angered by filth once there is anger dissatisfaction rage we will be compelled to act against this scourge the good thing is that gayatri is expressing her own anger and giving suggestions to me but she also goes on to say that she has made several efforts but could not succeed there has been an awareness ever since the launch of the cleanliness movement each person has become associated with it in a positive manner this has now truly taken the form of a movement there has been an increase in the disgust towards squalor when there is awareness and active participation in the movement it has its own significance but cleanliness is more about a habit than a movement this movement is geared towards bringing about a change in the habit a movement to inculcate the habit of cleanliness this movement can be accomplished collectively it is a difficult task but we have to do it i am sure that this resolve that has arisen in the younger generation in children in students in the youth augurs well for achieving good results i would urge my fellow countrymen who have heard gayatri s message in my mann ki baat today that it should be a message to all of us my dear countrymen right from the beginning since i have started the programme mann ki baat i have been receiving a lot of suggestions on one issue and in most of those people have expressed concern about food wastage we know that at home and at feasts and social gatherings we tend to serve ourselves more food than we need we put each and everything on offer on our plates but we fail to finish what we have taken we can t even finish half of what is on our plates and then leave it uneaten have you ever thought about how much food we waste have you ever thought how many poor people can be fed if we don t thus waste our food this is not something that needs to be taught as it is in our families mothers always tell their children to take only as much food they can eat there is always some effort made in this direction but still the apathy on this issue is a crime against society it is an injustice to the poor on the other hand if we are able to avoid wastage the family too benefits economically so while it is good to care about society this is beneficial to the family as well i am not urging too much on this issue but i would like this awareness to spread i do know some young persons who are active in such campaigns they have created mobile apps and when people call them about there being leftover food anywhere they collect it and put it to good use they work hard and these are our own young people you will find such people somewhere in each and every state of india the lives of these people can inspire us not to waste food we should take only as much as we can eat see these are the pathways leading towards change and those who are health conscious always say that there should always be some space left both in the stomach and on the plate now that we are talking about health 7th april is world health day united nations has resolved to provide universal health coverage for all by 2030 this year on the occasion of world health day on the 7th of april united nations has focused on depression which is the theme this year we are familiar with this word depression according to one estimate more than 35 crore people in the world suffer from depression the problem is that we are unable to fully comprehend it even amongst those around us and perhaps we also hesitate to talk about it openly with our family and friends the person suffering from depression too doesn t speak out himself as he feels a sense of shame about it i want to tell my countrymen that depression is not incurable there is a need to create a psychologically conducive environment to begin with the first mantra is the expression of depression instead of its suppression share openly what you are going through with your colleagues friends parents brothers and teachers sometimes one is overcome by a sense of loneliness students living in hostels are particularly vulnerable to it we are fortunate that we have been raised in joint families large families where there is communication which eliminates the chances of getting into depression but i would still like to tell parents that if you notice your son or daughter or any other member of your family earlier the entire family used to dine together but if someone in the family says no i will eat later he doesn t come to the dining table when the entire family is going on an outing he just says no i don t want to come today he professes a desire to be alone have you ever wondered why he does so you can be sure that this the first step towards depression if he prefers to stay away from a group and tends to be all by himself do make an effort to ensure that this does not happen he should be given an opportunity to be amongst people with whom he speaks openly try to encourage him to express himself to reveal and bring out his insecurities and complexes while engaging him in light hearted happy conversation this is a very good way of dealing with it depression can be the root cause of many mental and physical ailments just as diabetes can be the root cause of all sorts of diseases depression too destroys all our abilities to sustain to fight to display courage and to take a decision your friends your family your surroundings and environment all these can prevent you from going into depression and if you unfortunately has gone into it they can also pull you out of it there is another way if you are unable to express yourself to your family and friends then do one thing go out in society with a sense of service devote yourself with all your heart into helping others and sharing their joys and sorrows you will find that along with it your own inner sufferings will go on disappearing if you try to sympathise with the sufferings of others with a sense of service a new self confidence will be born within you by connecting with others serving them and serving them selflessly you will easily be able to shed the weight oppressing your own heart and mind yoga too is a good means for mental wellbeing yoga helps in relieving tension and stress and leads one towards a happy state of mind 21st june is the international day of yoga this will be the third year of its observance you all should start preparing for it right away collective yoga festivals should be celebrated with the participation of millions if you have any ideas for the third international yoga day please do send me your suggestions and guidance through my mobile application you could compose as many songs and poems on yoga as possible as these can be easily understood by the masses today i would like to say something especially to mothers and sisters also since health and wellbeing have been a major part of our conversation today recently the government of india has taken a very important decision the working class women in our country their numbers are increasing day by day their participation is increasing and this is a welcome trend but women also shoulder certain special responsibilities they look after the family they also have to share the financial responsibilities of running the household and because of that sometimes the newborn has to bear some injustice of neglect the government of india has taken a very important decision these working women will now be given maternity leave of 26 weeks instead of the earlier 12 weeks for their pregnancy and delivery there are now only two or three countries in the world that are ahead of us in this matter india has taken a very important decision for these working women sisters of ours the basic aim is to ensure proper care of the newborn the future citizen of india from the time of birth the newborn should get the complete love and attention of the mother that is how these children will become true assets of the country when they grow up mothers too will remain healthy and that is why this is such a landmark decision and this will benefit 18 lakh women working in the formal sector my dear countrymen we will celebrate the auspicious day of ram navami on the 5th of april mahavir jayanti is on the 9th of april and on the 14th of april is the birth anniversary of baba saheb ambedkar may the lives of all

discussion today many thoughts are arising in the mind and the heart this mutual connection through mann ki baat has reached its ninety ninth 99th distinction generally we get to hear that the turn around the ninety ninth 99th is very difficult in cricket nervous nineties is considered a very difficult stage but where there is mann ki baat of the people of india the inspiration therein is something else altogether i m also happy that there is a lot of enthusiasm among the people of the country regarding the hundredth 100th episode of mann ki baat i am receiving a lot of messages even phone calls today when we are celebrating the azadi ka amrit kaal moving forward with new resolutions i m also very eager to know your suggestions and thoughts regarding the hundredth 100th episode of mann ki baat i am eagerly waiting for such suggestions of yours although one always has to wait this time the wait is just longer your suggestions and ideas will make the hundredth 100th mann ki baat on the 30th of april extremely memorable my dear countrymen in mann ki baat we have mentioned thousands of people who dedicate their lives in the service of others there are many people who spend their entire pension towards the education of daughters some dedicate their whole life s earnings for the environment and the living beings in our country selfless charity parmarth has been placed so high that people do not hesitate to donate their all for the happiness of others that s why since childhood we are narrated the sagas of shivi and dadhichi who sacrificed their mortal selves friends in this era of modern medical science organ donation has become a very important means of imparting life to someone it is said that when a person donates one s body after death it creates a possibility for eight to nine people to get a new life it is matter of satisfaction that today awareness about organ donation is also rising in the country in the year 2013 there were less than five thousand cases of organ donation in our country but in 2022 this number has increased to more than fifteen thousand people who have done organ donation their families have actually accomplished a lot of punya friends i cherished a desire for a long time to know the mann ki baat of people who do such noble deeds and share it with the countrymen as well so today in mann ki baat a lovely daughter a father of a beautiful angel and her mother are going to join us the father s name is sukhbir singh sandhu ji and the mother s name is supreet kaur ji this family resides in amritsar punjab after many a prayer they were blessed with a very beautiful girl child a doll like daughter the people of the household lovingly named her ababat kaur the connotation of ababat is related to the service of others it is related to ameliorating the sufferings of others when she was only thirty nine days old she left this world but sukhbir singh sandhu ji and his wife supreet kaur ji their family took a very inspiring decision and the decision was organ donation of a daughter who was thirty nine days only sukhbir singh and his wife are present with us on the phone line at this moment come let s talk to them prime minister sukhbir ji namaste sukhbir ji namaste honorable prime minister sat shri akal prime minister sat shri akal ji sat shri akal ji sukhbir ji as i was thinking about mann ki baat today i felt that since the matter pertaining to ababat is so inspiring i should listen to it straight from you because when a daughter is born in the household it brings along many dreams and a lot of joy but i can also imagine how severe the pain would be if the daughter departs so soon the way you have taken the decision i want to know about it in its entirety sukhbir ji sir god had given us a very beautiful child a very lovely doll had arrived into our house as soon as she was born we came to know that she has a bunch of nerves in her brain due to which the size of her heart was getting bigger so we were taken aback that the child was healthy so beautiful and yet born with such a big problem so for the first 24 days the child was completely normal suddenly her heart stopped working completely so we quickly took her to the hospital where the doctors revived her but it took time to understand what was wrong with her such a big problem a small child and a sudden heart attack so we took her to pgi chandigarh for treatment there the child fought bravely during the treatment but the disease was such that its treatment was not possible at such a tender age the doctors tried a lot to revive her if the child were to approach the six month mark then one could have thought of operating on her but god had something else in mind when she was only 39 days old the doctor said that she had suffered a heart attack again now there was very little hope left so we both husband and wife weepingly came to the decision that we had seen her fighting bravely again and again as if she would go away now but then she was reviving so we felt that this child had some purpose in coming here so when they expressed utter helplessness both of us decided why not donate the organs of this child maybe there would be light in someone else s life then we contacted the administrative block of pgi and they guided us that only kidneys of such a small child can be taken the almighty gave us the courage it is the philosophy of guru nanak saheb that guided us in this decision prime minister in life you have truly abided by the teachings given by the gurus are you there supreet ji can we talk to her sukhbir ji yes sir supreet ji hello prime minister supreet ji i offer my pranam to you supreet ji namaskar sir namaskar sir it is a matter of great pride for us that you are talking to us prime minister you have done such a great deed and i believe that when the country will get to know of all this many people will come forward to save someone s life this contribution of ababat indeed is very big supreet ji sir this too was probably a bakshish from guru nanak badshah ji that gave us the courage to take such a decision prime minister nothing can happen without the blessings of the gurus supreet ji absolutely sir absolutely prime minister sukhbir ji when you were in the hospital and when the doctor gave you this shocking news even after that you and your wife took such a big decision with a calm and composed mind it is the teachings of the gurus that led to such an altruistic thought in the mind and in fact the meaning of ababat in common parlance is helpful i want to hear of the moment that this work was done sukhbir ji sir actually priya ji a family friend of ours had donated her organs and we got inspiration from her too so at that time we felt that the body which is there would merge into the five elements when someone gets separated forever and goes away his body is burnt or buried but if his organs are useful to someone then it is a good deed and we felt more proud at that time when the doctors told us that your daughter had become the youngest donor in india whose organs had been successfully transplanted so our heads were held high with pride that whereas we could not bring glory to our parents till this age a small child had come and raised our name in so many days and the bigger thing that today i am talking to you about this topic we are feeling proud prime minister sukhbir ji it is not as if only one part of your daughter is alive today your daughter has become an immortal traveler of the immortal saga of humanity she is present even today through a part of her body for this noble deed i appreciate you your wife your family sukhbir ji thank you sir friends the greatest feeling behind organ donation is that someone s life should be saved even while leaving people who wait for organ donation know how difficult it is to pass each moment of waiting and in such a situation when an organ donor or a cadaver donor is found then virtually a form of the almighty is seen in him snehlata chaudhary a resident of jharkhand was also like that who gave life to others as the almighty would snehlata chowdhary 63 donated her heart kidney and liver today in mann ki baat her son abhijit chowdhary is with us let s hear from him prime minister abhijeet ji namaskar abhijeet ji pranam sir prime minister abhijeet ji you are the son of such a mother who gave you life in a way by giving birth to you but even after her death your mother gave life to many people you abhijeet must certainly be feeling proud as a son abhijeet ji yes sir prime minister tell us a little bit about your mother under what circumstances the decision of organ donation was taken abhijeet ji there is a small village in jharkhand called seraikela where both my parents live they used to go on a morning walk continuously for the last twenty five years according to her routine she left for her morning walk at 4 in the morning at that time a motorcyclist hit her from behind and she fell instantly due to which she suffered severe head injury immediately we took her to sadar hospital seraikela where the doctor bandaged her but she was bleeding profusely and she had no consciousness immediately we took her to tata main hospital she underwent surgery there after 48 hours of observation the doctor said that there are very few chances from there on then we airlifted her and brought her to aiims delhi she was under treatment here for about 7 8 days after that the observation was fine but suddenly her blood pressure dropped a lot after that we came to know that she had suffered brain death then the doctor briefed us with the protocol about organ donation we could not tell our father that there is something like organ donation because we felt that he would not be able to absorb that so we wanted to remove from his mind that something like that was going on as soon as we told him that the matter of organ donation was going on then he said that no no this was the mother s wish and we had to do this we were very disappointed till the time we came to know that mummy will not be able to survive but as soon as this organ donation discussion started that disappointment turned to a very positive side and we entered a very positive environment while doing that we had counselling at 8 o clock in the night on the second day we did organ donation mummy had lofty thoughts in this matter earlier she used to be very active in social activities such as eye donation perhaps we were able to do such a big thing with that very thought in mind and because of my father s decision making regarding this matter this thing became possible prime minister how many people benefitted through the organs abhijeet ji her heart two kidneys liver and both eyes were donated so four people got their lives back and two people their eyes prime minister abhijeet ji both your father and mother are entitled to a respectful bow i salute them your father led your family members in such a big decision it is really very inspiring i believe that a mother is afterall a mother a mother is also an inspiration by herself but the traditions that the mother leaves behind become a great strength from generation to generation the inspiration for organ donation is reaching the whole country today through your mother i congratulate your whole family for this sacred and great work thank you abhijeet ji and do convey our regards to your father abhijeet ji definitely thank you friends whether it is 39 day old ababat kaur or 63 year old snehlata chowdhary great donors like them make us understand the importance of life in our country today there are a large number of needy people who are waiting for an organ donor in the hope of a healthy life it is a matter of utmost satisfaction for me that in order to make organ donation easy and to encourage it work is being done on a uniform policy in the whole country in this direction it has also been decided to remove the condition of domicile of the states that is now the patient will be able to go to any state of the country and register for receiving the organs the government has also decided to abolish the age limit of below 65 years for organ donation in the midst of these efforts i urge the countrymen that organ donors should come forward in maximum numbers one decision of yours can save the lives of many people can give life my dear countrymen this is the time of navratri the time to worship shakti today the potential of india which is emerging from a new perspective our woman power has a very big role in it recently many such examples have emerged before us you must have seen asia s first female loco pilot surekha yadav on social media surekha ji setting another record has also become the first woman loco pilot of vande bharat express as well this month producer guneet monga and director kartiki gonsalves brought laurels to the country by winning an oscar for their documentary the elephant whisperers sister jyotirmayi mohanty scientist of bhabha atomic research center has also notched another achievement for the country jyotirmoyee has received a special award from iupac in the field of chemistry and chemical engineering earlier this year india s under 19 women s cricket team created history by winning the t 20 world cup if you look at politics a new beginning has taken place in nagaland in nagaland for the first time in 75 years two women legislators have reached the vidhan sabha through their victory one of them has also been made a minister in the government of nagaland that is for the first time the people of the state have also got a woman minister friends a few days ago i also met those brave daughters who went to help the people of turkey after the devastating earthquake all these were part of the ndrf contingent their courage and skills are being praised all over the world india has also deployed a women only platoon in the peacekeeping force under the un mission today the daughters of the country are raising the flag of their bravery in all the three armed forces group captain shalija dhami has become the first woman air force officer to get a command appointment in a combat unit she has a flying experience of about 3000 hours similarly brave heart captain shiva chauhan of the indian army has become the first woman officer to be posted at siachen shiva will be stationed for three months in siachen where the temperature drops to minus sixty 60 degrees friends this list is so long that it is difficult to discuss all of them here all such women our daughters are today giving energy to india and india s dreams this energy of women power is the oxygen of a developed india my dear countrymen these days there is a lot of talk about clean energy renewable energy all over the world when i meet the people across the world they certainly talk about india s phenomenal success in this field especially the speed with which india is moving forward in the field of solar energy is a big achievement in itself the people of india have had a special relationship with the sun for centuries the scientific understanding we have about the power of the sun the traditions of worshiping the sun are rarely seen at other places i am happy that today every countryperson understands the importance of solar energy and also wants to contribute towards clean energy this spirit of sabka prayas is taking india s solar mission forward today in pune maharashtra one such excellent effort has caught my attention here the people of msr olive housing society have decided that they would now run things of common utility like drinking water lift and lights in the society with solar energy only after this everyone together in this society got solar panels installed today about 90 thousand kilowatt hour electricity is being generated from these solar panels every year this is resulting in saving of about 40 000 rupees every month all the people of the society are getting the benefit of this savings friends like pune the people of diu in daman diu which is a separate district have also done a wonderful job you must know that diu is near somnath diu has become the first district in india which is using 100 clean energy for all day time needs the mantra of this success of diu is also sabka prayas once upon a time resources for power generation were a challenge people chose solar energy as a solution to this challenge here solar panels were installed on barren land and many buildings through these panels more electricity is being generated in diu than what is required during the day time through this solar project about 52 crore rupees have also been saved on the purchase of electricity due to this the environment has also been saved a lot friends what they have done in pune and diu such efforts are being made in many other places across the country this shows how sensitive we indians are about the environment and nature and how our country is very alert for the future generations i heartily appreciate all such efforts my dear countrymen in our country with the passage of time according to the situation and circumstances many traditions develop these traditions increase the strength of our culture and also give it new vitality daily a few months ago one such tradition started in kashi during the kashi tamil sangamam the centuries old historical and cultural ties between kashi and the tamil region were celebrated the spirit of ek bharat shreshtha bharat gives strength to our country when we know and learn about each other this feeling of oneness strengthens with this spirit of unity saurashtra tamil sangamam will be held in different parts of gujarat next month the saurashtra tamil sangamam will run from april 17 to 30 some listeners of mann ki baat must be wondering what the relation of saurashtra in gujarat with tamil nadu is let me tell you centuries ago many people from saurashtra had settled in different parts of tamil nadu these people are still known as saurashtri tamil even today some glimpses of saurashtra can be found in their food habits lifestyle and social rituals many people from tamil nadu have written appreciative letters to me regarding this event jayachandran ji who lives in madurai has written something very poignant he said that after a thousand years for the first time someone has thought about the saurashtra tamil relations and brought to the fore the people who settled in tamil nadu from saurashtra jayachandran s words are the expression of thousands of tamil brothers and sisters friends i would like to inform the listeners of mann ki baat about a piece of news related to assam this too strengthens the spirit of ek bharat shreshtha bharat you all know that we are celebrating the 400th birth anniversary of veer lachit borphukan ji the brave lachit borphukan had liberated guwahati from the clutches of the tyrannical mughal sultanate today the country is getting acquainted with the indomitable courage of this great warrior a few days ago a campaign for essay writing based on the life of lachit borphukan was launched you will be surprised to know that about 45 lakh people sent essays for this you will also be happy to know that now it has become a guinness record and the biggest thing and a matter of great happiness is that these essays that have been written and sent by the people on veer lachit borphukan have been written in about 23 different languages among them apart from the assamese language people have sent essays in languages like hindi english bangla bodo nepali sanskrit and santhali i express my heartfelt appreciation to everyone who has been a part of this effort my dear countrymen when it comes to kashmir or srinagar the first picture that comes to our mind is of her valleys and dal lake all of us would like to enjoy the views of dal lake however there is one more thing special about dal lake dal lake is also known for its delicious lotus stems also known as kamal kakdi lotus stems are known by different names in different places across the country in kashmir they are called nadru the demand for nadru of kashmir is continuously increasing in light of this demand farmers cultivating nadru in dal lake have formed an fpo about 250 farmers have joined this fpo today these farmers have started exporting their nadru to foreign countries just some time back these farmers sent two consignments to uae this success is not only bringing a name to kashmir but also it has increased the income of hundreds of farmers friends another such effort of the people of kashmir related to agriculture is diffusing the fragrance of its success these days you must be wondering why i am talking about the fragrance of success well it is a matter of fragrance and it is a matter of aroma there is a town bhadarwah in the doda district of jammu and kashmir here the farmers had been engaged in traditional maize cultivation for decades but some farmers thought of doing something different they turned to floriculture that is the cultivation of flowers today around two and a half thousand farmers are cultivating lavender here they have also been handheld through the aroma mission of the central government this new cultivation has greatly increased the income of the farmers and today along with the lavender the fragrance of their success is spreading far and wide friends when there is talk of kashmir talk of lotus talk of flowers talk of fragrance then it is very natural to remember maa sharda who is seated on the lotus flower a few days ago the grand temple of maa sharda was inaugurated in kupwara this temple is built on the same route one would use to go to visit sharda peeth the local people have helped a lot in the construction of this temple i congratulate the people of jammu and kashmir for this auspicious work my dear countrymen that s all for this edition of mann ki baat i will meet you next time in the hundredth episode of mann ki baat i urge you all to send your suggestions in this month of march from holi to navratri we

babasaheb ambedkar both these great men made unprecedented contributions to eradicate discrimination from society today in azadi ka amritkaal we need to learn from such great personalities and take constant inspiration from them we have to keep our duties at the forefront friends at this time cases of corona are also rising in some places that s why all of you must take precautions and be mindful of cleanliness we will meet again next month in the 100th episode of mann ki baat till then i take leave of you thank you namaskar sharing this month s mannkibaat tune in inputs from citizens

26-Sep-21,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on September 26, 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized the importance of World Rivers Day, highlighting the traditional reverence for rivers in India. He spoke of the need to address river pollution and promote river festivals to connect people with India's water bodies. The Prime Minister also stressed the significance of cleanliness and its role in the freedom movement, encouraging the continuation of the Swachh Bharat campaign. He praised the achievements of differently-abled individuals, shared stories of innovative agricultural initiatives, and discussed the potential of medicinal plants and herbal products. On the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, he lauded his Antyodaya philosophy and Ayushman Bharat healthcare scheme. Modi urged the youth to embrace these ideals and highlighted the importance of not giving up in the face of adversity. He emphasized the collective responsibility in the ongoing fight against COVID-19, calling on citizens to get vaccinated and ensure others are also protected, all while observing necessary safety protocols.",26-sep-2021 my dear countrymen namaskar you are aware that for an important programme i have to leave for america hence i thought it would be apt to record mann ki baat prior to my departure to america the day of mann ki baat this september is important on another count date wise routinely we do remember a lot of days we even celebrate myriad days and if you ask young sons daughters at home they are likely to furnish out an entire list of days of the year with their chronological relevance but there is one more day that all of us must remember this day is one that is immensely congruent to the traditions of india it s one that connects us with our traditions that we have been following for centuries that is world rivers day it has been articulated here pibanti naddhah swayameva naambha meaning that rivers do not drink their own water they give it away altruistically for us rivers are not mere physical entities for us a river is a living unit and that is exactly why we refer to rivers as mother numerous festivals festive occasions functions of ours occasions to rejoice take place in the very laps of these mothers all of you are aware with the advent of the month of magh in our country a lot of people perform kalpvaas on the banks of mother ganga or other rivers for an entire month this tradition has ceased now but in earlier times it was customary to remember rivers while bathing at home this tradition of remembering rivers may have gone extinct or exists sparsely but there used to be a great tradition that would take one on a tour across the vastness of india while bathing early morning a cerebral pilgrimage it used to be a source of inspiration to connect with every nook and corner of the country and of course in india it has been customary to chant a shlok while bathing gange cha yamune chaiva godavari saraswati narmade sindhu kaveri jale asmin sannidhim kuru earlier at our homes the elderly in the family would make children memorise the shlok this also led to germinating aastha faith towards rivers in our country it would inscribe an illustrated map of the great land of india on the psyche that used to establish an emotional connect with rivers it would result in nurturing a harmonious credence towards the very river that embodied the mother sentimentally as well as visually as a way of life too it was a way to instill sanskaar the value system gamut friends now that we are discussing the significance of rivers in our country it is but natural for everyone to raise a question one in fact has the right to do so and answering that question is our responsibility too anyone can question you are singing so many songs dedicated to rivers referring to a river as a mother then why is it that the river gets polluted our scriptures distinctly disapprove of polluting rivers even a bit and our traditions have been synchronous with the thought you know of course that the western region of our india especially gujarat and rajasthan suffer from scarcity of water they face famines many a time now that is why a new tradition has developed in the social life there for example when it starts raining in gujarat jal jeelani ekadashi is celebrated there this means it is synonymous with what we term as catch the rain in today s times accumulating each and every drop of water jal jeelani on similar lines after the rains in bihar and other regions of the east the great festival of chhatth is celebrated i hope that keeping the chatth pooja in mind preparations for cleaning and repairing riverbanks and ghats would have commenced we can very well undertake the endeavour of cleaning rivers and freeing them of pollution with collective effort and support the namami gange mission too is making advances today collective efforts of all in a way mass awareness a mass movement has a major role to play in that friends when one is referring to the river when mother ganga is being talked about one is tempted to draw your attention to another aspect when namami gange is being referred to one thing is certain to draw your attention especially that of the youth these days a special e auction is being held this electronic auction pertains to gifts presented to me by people from time to time the money that accrues through this e auction is dedicated solely to the namami gange campaign the affectionate warm spirit with which you present me gifts that very sentiment gets bolstered through this campaign friends in order to rejuvenate rivers throughout the country in order to cleanse waters the government and social service organizations keep undertaking one endeavour or the other and this is not about the present day it is going on for decades now there are some people who have dedicated themselves to these causes and it is this very tradition this very endeavour this very faith that has saved our rivers whenever such news come to my notice from any corner of india it evokes immense respect in my heart for people who embark upon such tasks and i also feel like sharing that with you take a look at vellore and thiruvannamalai districts of tamilnadu whose example i wish to cite a river named naagnadi flows there years ago the naagnadi had all dried up because of that the water level there had terribly gone down but the womenfolk there took up the cudgels to rejuvenate their river and then lo and behold they got people connected dug up canals through public participation constructed check dams and recharge wells friends you too would be glad to know that today the river is brimming with water and truly when a river is full of water it lends such tranquility to the mind i have actually witnessed the experience many of you might be aware that on the very banks of river sabarmati mahatma gandhi set up the sabarmati ashram during the last few decades the river had dried up 6 to 8 months a year no water was even visible there but river narmada and river sabarmati were linked today if you go to ahmedabad the waters of river sabarmati fill one s heart with such joy similarly our sisters from tamilnadu are undertaking myriad such tasks many such tasks are being done in various corners of the country i know for sure that many of our saints our gurus associated with our religious traditions are doing a lot for the sake of water and rivers along with their spiritual pursuits many of them are running campaigns to plant trees along riverbanks at places dirty water is being prevented from flowing into rivers friends when we are celebrating world river day today i praise and greet all dedicated to this work but to all people living near every river to countrymen i will urge that in india in all corners at least once in a year a river festival must be celebrated my dear countrymen never make the mistake of treating minor issues little things as small through tiny efforts at times very significant changes occur and if we look towards the life of mahatma gandhi ji we will find every moment how even small things had so much importance and how using small issues he accomplished big resolutions our youth today must know how the campaign for cleanliness continuously gave energy to our freedom movement it was mahatma gandhi who turned cleanliness into a mass movement mahatma gandhi had connected cleanliness to the dream of independence today after so many decades the cleanliness movement has once again connected the country to the dream of a new india and this is also becoming a campaign to change our habits too and we must not forget that this cleanliness is a programme this cleanliness is a responsibility of the transition of sanskar from generation to generation and when the campaign for cleanliness continues generation after generation in the entire society cleanliness as a trait gets imbibed and that is why this is not a subject of a year or two of one government or the other government generation after generation with alertness continually without being tired or stopping with high reverence we have to remain associated with cleanliness and continue the campaign for cleanliness and i have said earlier too that this cleanliness is a great tribute by this country to revered bapu and we have to keep paying this tribute every time continuously friends people know that i don t ever let go any chance to speak in connection with cleanliness and possibly that is why a listener of mann ki baat shriman ramesh patel ji has written to me that learning from bapu in this amrit mahotsav of freedom we should take the resolve of economic cleanliness too the way building of toilets enhanced the dignity of poor similarly economic cleanliness ensures rights of the poor eases their life you are aware of the campaign that the country started regarding jandhan accounts today because of this the rightful money of the poor is getting credited directly into their accounts and because of this obstacles like corruption have reduced very significantly it is true that technology can help a lot in economic cleanliness it is matter of delight for us that even in villages the common person is getting connected in the direction of digital transactions through fin tech upi its prevalence has begun increasing i will tell you a figure which will make you proud during last august 355 crore upi transactions took place in one month that is more than nearly 350 crore transactions that is we can say that during the month of august upi was used for digital transactions more than 350 crore times today on an average digital payments of more than 2 lakh crore rupees is happening through upi through this the economy of the country is acquiring cleanliness and transparency and we all know that now the importance of fin tech is increasing a lot friends bapu had connected cleanliness with independence the same way he had made khadi the identity of freedom today in the 75 th year of freedom when we are celebrating the amrit mahotsav of independence we can say with satisfaction today that our young generation today is giving khadi the place of pride that khadi had during freedom struggle today the production of khadi and handloom has increased multiple times and its demand too has increased you too know that there were many such occasions when business of more than a crore rupees has been transacted in the khadi showroom in delhi i too would like to remind you again that on the 2 nd of october on revered bapu s birth anniversary let us together aim for another new record in your city wherever khadi is sold handloom is sold handicraft is sold and now that the festival of diwali is there for the festive season every khadi handloom cottage industry purchase of yours should strengthen the campaign for vocal for local it should break all old records friends in this period of amrit mahotsav a campaign to disseminate to everyone the untold stories of the history of freedom is also going on and for this upcoming writers youth of the country and the world were called upon for this more than 13 thousand people have registered till now and that too in 14 different languages and for me a thing of joy also is that non resident indians from more than 20 countries have expressed their wish to join this campaign there is another interesting information more than nearly 5000 upcoming writers are searching out tales of struggle for freedom they have taken the lead to write something on those who are unsung heroes who are un named whose names don t appear on the pages of history on the theme of such unsung heroes on their lives on those events that is the youth of the country have decided to bring forth the history of those freedom fighters who were not even discussed during the last 75 years i appeal to all the listeners i appeal to all those connected with the field of education you too motivate the youth you too come forward and it is my firm belief that during the amrit mahotsav of independence the people who are working for writing history will make history as well my dear countrymen we all know about the siachen glacier the cold there is so terrible that it is beyond capacity of a common person to live there with snow spread far and wide there is no sign of any vegetation anywhere the temperature here dips to even minus 60 degrees a few days ago the feat that a team of 8 divyang persons performed in this inaccessible region of siachen is a matter of pride for every countryman this team created a world record by hoisting its flag on the kumar post situated at an altitude of more than 15 thousand feet at the siachen glacier despite the challenges of physical ability the feats that these divyangs have achieved are an inspiration for the whole country and when you get to know about the members of this team you will also be filled with courage and enthusiasm just like i was the names of these brave divyangs are mahesh nehra akshat rawat of uttarakhand pushpak gawande of maharashtra ajay kumar of haryana lobsang chospel of ladakh major dwarkesh of tamil nadu irfan ahmed mir of jammu and kashmir and chongjin ingmo of himachal pradesh this operation to conquer the siachen glacier has been successful because of the veterans of the special forces of the indian army i commend the team for this historic and unprecedented achievement it also shows the spirit of our countrymen to tackle every challenge with a can do culture a can do determination and a can do attitude friends today many efforts are being made for the welfare of divyangjan in the country i got a chance to know about one such effort being made in uttar pradesh one teacher one call this unique effort in bareilly is showing a new path to the divyang children this campaign is being led by the principal of a school in dabhaura gangapur deepmala pandey ji during the corona period due to this campaign not only did the admission of a large number of children become possible more than 350 teachers have also joined it with a spirit of service these teachers go from village to village calling for divyang children looking out for them and then ensuring their admission in one school or the other i deeply appreciate this noble effort of deepmala ji and her fellow teachers for the sake of divyangjans every such effort in the field of education is going to shape the future of our country my dear countrymen the condition of our lives today is such that the word corona resonates in our ears many times a day the biggest global pandemic in a hundred years covid 19 has taught every countryman a lot today there has been an increase in curiosity and awareness about healthcare and wellness traditionally natural products which are beneficial for wellness and health are available in abundance in our country patayat sahu ji who lives in nandol kalahandi odisha has been doing unique work in this area for years he has planted medicinal plants on one and a half acres of land not only this sahu ji has also carried out documentation of these medicinal plants satish ji of ranchi has shared another similar information to me through a letter satish ji has drawn my attention to an aloe vera village in jharkhand the women of deori village near ranchi had undergone training in aloe vera cultivation from birsa agricultural school under the leadership of manju kachhap ji after this they started cultivating aloe vera not only did this farming benefit in the field of health the income of these women also increased they had good income even during the covid pandemic one of the major reasons for this was that the companies making sanitizers were buying aloe vera directly from them today a team of about forty women is involved in this work and aloe vera is cultivated over many acres whether it is patayat sahu ji of odisha or this team of women in deori the way they have linked agriculture with the field of health is an example in itself friends the 2nd of october also marks the birth anniversary of lal bahadur shastri ji in his memory this day also teaches us about those who attempt new experiments in agriculture to promote start ups in the field of medicinal plants an incubator by the name of medi hub tbi is operational in anand gujarat in a very short time this incubator associated with medicinal and aromatic plants has supported the business idea of 15 entrepreneurs sudha chebrolu ji has launched her start up only after getting the help of this incubator priority is given to women in this company and they are also responsible for innovative herbal formulations another such entrepreneur is subhashree ji who has also received help from this medicinal and aromatic plants incubator subhashree ji s company is working in the field of herbal room and car fresheners she has also created a herbal terrace garden which has more than 400 medicinal herbs friends the ministry of ayush has taken an interesting initiative to increase awareness about medicinal and herbal plants among children and professor ayushman ji has taken the lead it is possible that you must be wondering who professor ayushman is actually professor ayushman is the name of a comic book in this short stories have been prepared through different cartoon characters along with this the usefulness of healthy medicinal plants like aloe vera tulsi amla giloy neem ashwagandha and brahmi has been mentioned friends in the current context with the trend of people around the world regarding medicinal plants and herbal products increasing india has immense potential in the past there has been a significant increase in the export of ayurvedic and herbal products i urge scientists researchers and people associated with the start up world to pay attention to such products which not only increase the wellness and immunity of the people but also help in increasing the income of our farmers and youth friends moving beyond traditional farming novel initiatives and options are being done in agriculture and are continuously creating new means of self employment the story of two brothers from pulwama is also an example of this the way bilal ahmed sheikh and munir ahmed sheikh found new avenues for themselves in pulwama jammu and kashmir they are an example of new india 39 years old bilal ahmed ji is highly qualified he has obtained many degrees he is now using his experience of higher education by launching his own start up in agriculture bilal ji has installed a unit of vermi composting at his home the bio fertilizer prepared from this unit has not only benefited a lot in agriculture it has also brought employment opportunities to the people every year farmers are getting about three thousand quintals of vermicompost from the units managed by these brothers today 15 people are also working in this vermicomposting unit a large number of people are reaching to see this unit and most of them are young people who want to do something in the agriculture sector the sheikh brothers of pulwama took a pledge to become a job creator instead of a job seeker and today they are showing a new path not only to jammu and kashmir but to the people across the country as well my dear countrymen the 25th of september is the birth anniversary of a great son of the country pandit deen dayal upadhyay ji deen dayal ji is one of the greatest thinkers of the last century his economic philosophy his policies aimed at empowering the society the path of antyodaya shown by him remain as relevant in the present context and are also inspirational three years ago on his birth anniversary the 25th of september the world s largest health assurance scheme ayushman bharat scheme was implemented today more than two and a half crore impoverished people of the country have got free treatment up to rs 5 lakh in the hospital under the ayushman bharat scheme such a massive scheme for the poor is dedicated to the antyodaya philosophy of deen dayal ji if the youth of today inculcate values and ideals into their lives it can be of great benefit to them once in lucknow deen dayal ji had said how many good things good qualities there are we derive all these from the society itself we have to pay the debt of society we must think on these lines that is deen dayal ji taught us that we take so much from society from the country whatever it be it is only because of the country thus we should think about how we will repay our debt towards the country this is a significant message for today s youth friends from the life of deen dayal ji we also get a lesson to never give up despite the adverse political and ideological circumstances he never wavered from the vision of a swadeshi home grown model for the development of india today many young people want to move ahead by breaking away from the oft treaded paths they want to do things their own way deen dayal ji s life can teach them a lot that is why i urge our youngsters to definitely know about him my dear countrymen we touched upon many topics today like we were discussing the time to come is of festivals the whole country is also going to celebrate the festival of the victory over untruth by maryada purushottam shri ram but during this festival we have to remember about one more fight that is the country s fight against corona team india is making new records everyday in this fight with regards to vaccination the country has made many such records which are being talked about the world over every indian has an important role in this fight we have to get the vaccine administered when our turn comes but we also have to take care that no one is left out of this circle of safety those around you who have not got vaccinated also have to be taken to the vaccine center even after getting vaccinated the necessary protocol has to be followed i hope that once again team india will keep the flag flying high in this fight next time we will discuss some more topics in mann ki baat wishing you all every countryman the best for the fortcoming festivals thank you mannkibaat has begun tune in we mark so many days but there is one more day we should

naddhah swayameva naambha meaning that rivers do not drink their own water they give it away altruistically for us rivers are not mere physical entities for us a river is a living unit and that is

of violence comes in from one part of the country it is only natural of be concerned ours is the country of buddha and gandhi it is the land of sardar patel who gave up his all for the unity of the nation for centuries our forefathers have imbibed community values nonviolence mutual respect these are inherent to us we have been hearing and saying ahimsa parmo dharmah from our childhood in my address from the ramparts of the red fort i had said that violence in the name of faith will not be tolerated whether it is communal belief systems whether it is subscribing to political ideologies whether it is allegiance to a person or customs and traditions no one has the right to take the law into one s own hands in the name of one s beliefs in the constitution given to us by dr baba saheb ambedkar there is every provision for ensuring justice for each and every person i want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own handsand are on the path of violent suppression whether it is a person or a group neither this country nor any government will tolerate it each and every person will have to abide by the law the law will fix accountability and the guilty will unquestionably be punished my dear countrymen our country is a land of diversities these diversities are not limited to our cuisine life style and attire we observe diversity in every walk of life even our festivals are replete with diversity ours is arich cultural heritage spanning thousands of years when we look at our cultural traditions social customs historical events there would hardly be a day left in the year which is not connected with a festival you would have noticed that all our festivals follow the almanac of nature there is a direct connect with nature many of our festivals are linked straightaway with farmers and fishermen speaking about festivals today i would first like to wish you all michhamidukkadam the jain community celebrated the samvatsari parva yesterday in the month of bhadra paryushanparva is celebrated by the jain community the last day of paryushanparva is observed as samvatsari this is indeed a remarkable tradition the festival of samvatsari is symbolic of forgiveness non violence and brotherhood it is also known as the kshamavaniparva and on this day people traditionally greet each other with michhamidukkadam we have been hearing in our shaastras our holy texts kshamaveerasya bhushanam that is forgiveness is the adornment of the brave the one who forgives is valiant and mahatma gandhi always said that forgiveness is the quality of great men shakespeare in his play the merchant of venice while explaining the importance of forgiveness has written mercy is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes meaning the forgiver and the forgiven both stand to receive divine blessing my dear countrymen ganesh chaturthi is being celebrated with great fervor all across the country when we speak of ganesh chaturthi it is but natural to talk about sarvajanik ganeshotsav that is community celebrations of the ganesh festival this tradition was established by bal gangadhar tilak 125 years ago and it was 125 years ago that sarvajanik ganeshotsav became a symbol of india s struggle for freedom and after independence this festival has become a vehicle of raising social and educational awareness ganesh chaturthi is a ten day festival this mahaparva mega festival stands for unity equality integrity and honesty my heartiest greetings to all of you on the occasion of ganeshotsav the festival of onam is being celebrated in kerela of the numerous colourful festivals of india onam is a prime festival of kerela this festival is known for its social and cultural significance this festival showcases the rich cultural heritage of kerala it gives the message of love and harmony awakens new hopes and aspirations and gives new confidence to the people our festivals are now becoming great attractions for tourism and i would like to mention to my countrymen that festivals like navaratri in gujarat or durga utsav in bengal are tremendous tourist attractions other festivals of our country too provide an opportunity to attract foreign visitors we should think about what more can be done in this direction in this series of festivals eid ul zuha will be celebrated in a few days from now heartiest felicitations and best wishes to all countrymen on the occasion of eid ul zuha festivals are of course symbols of faith and belief in the new india we should transform them into symbols of cleanliness as well in individual households festivals and cleanliness are linked together in fact preparations for festivals always begin with cleaning this is nothing new for us but it is important to convert it into a social character public cleanliness must be insisted upon not just in our homes but in our villages towns cities states and in our entire country cleanliness has to be inextricably linked to our festivals my dear countrymen definitions of being modern are perpetually changing these days a new measure to gauge a new dimension a new parameter has come in to being it determines what your upbringing has been how modern you are how modern your thinking is and that measure is your level of environment consciousness are your activities ecofriendly environment friendly or otherwise it is considered to be unacceptable in society today of you are not environment friendly and as a result of this i find that the ecofriendly ganpati in this ganesh festival has turned into a huge campaign if you go on youtube you will see that children in every home are making earthen ganesh idols and are colouring them some are using vegetable colours while some are pasting bits and pieces of paper all sorts of experiments are being carried out in every family this is probably the first of its kind the most widespread experiment in environment consciousness media houses too are making a great effort in training people inspiring them and guiding them towards ecofriendly ganesh idols what a massive transformation this has been a pleasant one at that and as i mentioned our country is blessed with millions and millions of the brightest of brains and it is nice to see all sorts of new innovations someone told me about a gentleman who is an engineer and who has collected and combined special varieties of clay to give training in making ganesh idols the ganesh visarjan or immersion is done in a small bucket of water where the idol dissolves within no time and he didn t stop there a tulsi holy basil sapling was sowed in it the campaign for cleanliness which was initiated three years ago will be marking its third anniversary on the 2nd of october and the positive results are now being seen toilets have increased from 39 to almost 67 of the population more than two lakh thirty thousand villages have declared themselves open defecation free gujarat saw devastating floods recently many people lost their lives when the waters receded there was so much filth everywhere that is when in dhanera in the banaskantha district of gujarat volunteers of jamiat ulema e hind cleaned twenty two affected temples and two mosques in a phased manner they came together and toiled collectively the volunteers of jamiat ulema e hindset a fine inspiring example of unity for cleanliness if this committed effort towards cleanliness become inherent to us our country will certainly take our nation to greater heights my dear countrymen i call upon you to begin a campaign swachchata hi sewa

the form of a movement i urge all ngos schools colleges social cultural and political leaders people in the government collectors and sarpanches to begin creating an environment of cleanliness at

imagine the inner bliss of paying homage to our revered bapu with fifteen days of this cleanliness campaign swachchata hi seva when we celebrate gandhi jayanti on the 2nd of october my dear countrymen i want to specially express my indebtedness to you i want to thank you from the core of my heart not because you have been connected with mann ki baat for such a long time i want to express my gratitude and indebtedness as millions of people from across the country come together with mann ki baat the number of listeners are in crores out of which lakhs of people write letters to me send messages and get their messages recorded on phone which is a huge treasure for me this has become a great opportunity for me to understand the hearts and minds of one and all much as you wait for mann ki baat i await your messages with greater eagerness i always look forward with anticipation because i find so much to learn from all that you share it is an opportunity to test my endeavors on this touchstone even the smallest of your suggestions help me in thinking anew on a wide variety of subjects i therefore express my heartfelt gratitude for your contributions and also my indebtedness to you my endeavor always is to see for myself hear read and understand your thoughts all sorts of things come to me now take this phone call for example you will be able to correlate with it you too would feel that you would ve committed the same mistake sometimes certain things become a part of our habits that we don t even realize that we are doing something wrong pradhan mantri ji i am aparna from pune i want to tell you about a friend of mine she always tries to help others but one habit of hers amazes me i went for shopping with her at a mall she coolly spent two thousand rupees on a sari and four hundred and fifty rupees on a pizza whereas she haggled for a long time over merely five rupees with the auto driver who took us to the mall on the way back we stopped to buy vegetables and again she haggled with the vendors to save 4 5 rupees i feel very bad we spend extravagantly in high places without a single thought but when it comes to our hardworking brethren we quarrel with them over small amounts we don t trust them please speak about this on mann ki baat now after listening to this phone call i am certain that you would have been shocked and awakened and would probably have resolved not to repeat such a mistake don t you feel that whenever a vendor comes to your door to sell something on his rounds when we come into contact with small shopkeepers vegetable sellers auto rickshaw drivers in fact any person who earns through sheer hard work we start bargaining with him haggling with him no not so much make it two rupees less five rupees less and it is us the same people who go to dine at a fine restaurant we don t even bother to check the bill we just go ahead and pay the money without thinking twice not just this when we go to a showroom to buy a saree we don t bargain but when it comes to someone poor we just cannot resist bargaining have you ever wondered what a poor man goes through it is not a matter of two or five rupees it hurts him deeply when he feels that you are questioning his honesty two or five rupees make no difference to your life but have you thought how much heartache this petty habit of yours can cause him madam i am grateful to you for calling me with this touching message i am certain that my countrymen if they are in the habit of behaving in this way with the poor will now stop doing so my dear young friends the country celebrates national sports day on the 29th of august this is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player hockey wizard major dhyan chand ji his contribution to hockey was unparalleled i am reminding you of this because i want the younger generation of our country to take part in sports sports should become a part of our lives if we are a young nation our youth should get manifested in the field sports as well sports means physical fitness mental alertness and personality enhancement what else does one need sports in a way is a recipe that brings people together the young generation of our country should come forward in the world of sports and in today s computer era i would like to alert you to the fact that the playing field is far more important than the play station play fifa on the computer but sometimes show your skills with the football out in the field you must be playing cricket on the computer but the pleasure of actually playing cricket in an open field under the sky is something else there was a time when the children in the family went out to play the mother would first ask when will you come back home now the times are such that children when they come home they either start watching cartoons in a corner or are glued to mobile games and the mother has to shout when will you go out how times have changed there was a time when the mother would demand to know when her son would be back and today she demands to know when he will go out young friends the sports ministry is launching a sports talent search portal to search for sporting talent and to groom them any talented child who has an achievement in sports can upload his biodata or video on this portal the ministry of sports will impart training to selected emerging players the ministry is

these daughters my dear countrymen we celebrate 5th september as teacher s day it is the birthday of our former president dr radhakrishnan ji he was the president but all through his life he saw himself as a teacher he preferred to live a teacher s life he was committed to being a teacher he was a scholar a diplomat the president of india and yet quintessentially a teacher i salute him the great scientist albert einstein said it is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge the most important quality of a teacher is to awaken in his students a sense of creativity and the joy of learning as we celebrate teacher s day this year can we come together and take a resolve can we run a campaign in mission mode teach to transform educate to empower

success in life such an atmosphere can be created by our schools our colleges our teachers our educational institutions when we speak about transformation in our country we must think of our teachers as we do of our mothers the teacher plays a vital role in transformation in the life of every teacher there are incidents of simple efforts that succeeded in bringing about a transformation in somebody s life we will play a big role in the transformation of the nation if we make a collective effort come let s move forward with the mantra teach to transform pranam pradhan mantri ji i am dr ananya awasthi i am a resident of mumbai and work for the india research centre of harvard university as a researcher i have been specially interested in financial inclusion with reference to the social schemes related to financial inclusion my question to you is in the backdrop of the jan dhanyojna launched in 2014 can you say that do the statistics show that today three years later india is financially more secure and stronger and whether this empowerment and benefits have percolated down to our women farmers and workers in villages and small towns thank you my dear countrymen the pradhan mantri jan dhanyojna financial inclusion had been a point of discussion amongst financial pundits not just in india but all over the world on the 28th of august 2014 we had launched this campaign with a dream in our hearts tomorrow on the 28th of august the pradhan mantri jan dhanyojna will complete three years thirty crore new families have been linked to this scheme bank accounts have been opened this number is larger than the population of many countries of the world and today i feel a great sense of fulfilment that within three years the last man on the fringes of society has become a part of the mainstream economy of the country his ways have changed he has now started going to the bank he has started saving his money he feels financially secure when there is cash in the hand or in the pocket or at home one is tempted to indulge in wasteful expenditure there is now an air of prudence he is now beginning to understand that the money can be of use for his children the money can be used productively in the days to come not just this when a poor person sees a rupay card in his pocket he finds himself to be equal to the privileged that if they have a credit card in their pockets i too have a rupay card in mind he feels a sense of dignity in the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojna almost 65 thousand crore rupees have deposited in banks by our underprivileged brethren in a way this is a saving for the poor this is his empowerment for the future and those who opened their accounts under the pradhan mantri jan dhanyojna have received the benefit of insurance as well schemes like pradhan mantri jeewan jyoti bima yojna pradhan mantri suraksha bima yojna with a small premium of one rupee or thirty rupees are giving a new sense of confidence to the poor for many families in times of adversity or on the demise of the head of the family through the one rupee insurance they received two lakh rupees in a matter of days pradhan mantri mudra yojna start up yojna stand up yojna for dalits adivasis women educated youth youth who want to stand on their own feet for millions and millions through pradhan mantri mudra yojna they have been able to get loans from banks without any guarantee they have been able to stand on their own feet and have succeeded in giving employment to one or two other people as well banks have conducted surveys about how the common man has benefitted from jan dhanyojna from insurance schemes from rupay card and pradhan mantri mudra yojna i recently met a few bankers who shared inspiring stories from their survey there isn t enough time today but i would certainly like request the bankers to upload these inspiring stories on mygov in so that people can read them and be inspired by how a scheme can bring about transformation in the life of a person how it can bring a new energy a new confidence hundreds of examples have come before me i will try my best to bring these to you and the media can also take advantage of these inspiring stories they too can interview such people and inspire the young generation my dear countrymen once again i wish you michchamidukkadm thank you very much on one hand we

success of chandrayaan has enhanced this atmosphere of celebration manifold it has been more than three days that chandrayaan has reached the moon this success is so grand that any amount of discussion about it would be inadequate when i am talking to you today i am reminded of a few lines of an old poem of mine raise your head high to slice the densest of clouds it s time to devote ourselves to the resolve of spreading radiance well the sun has just risen treading ahead with a firm resolve crossing every deterrent nay barrier to dispel the scourge of utter darkness well the sun has just risen and then one realises even the sun has just risen albeit shining across many a dense cloud yet holding the head sky high my family members on the 23rd of august india and india s chandrayaan have proved that some suns of resolve rise on the moon as well mission chandrayaan has become a symbol of the spirit of new india which wants to ensure victory and also knows how to win in any situation friends there has been one aspect of this mission which i specially want to discuss with all of you today you might remember this time i have expressed from red fort that we have to strengthen women led development as a national character where the might of women power is added the impossible can also be made possible india s mission chandrayaan is also a live example of woman power many women scientists and engineers have been directly involved in this entire mission they have handled many important responsibilities like project director project manager of different systems the daughters of india are now challenging even the space which is considered infinite when the daughters of a country become so ambitious who can stop that country from becoming developed friends we have accomplished such a lofty flight since today our dreams are big and our efforts are also big along with our scientists other sectors have also played an important role in the success of chandrayaan 3 many countrymen have contributed in ensuring all the parts and meeting technical requirements when everyone s efforts converged success was also achieved this is the biggest success

the country wherever the g 20 delegates went people warmly welcomed them these delegates were very impressed seeing the diversity of our country and our vibrant democracy they also realized that there are so many possibilities in india friends our presidency of the g 20 is a people s presidency in which the spirit of public participation is at the forefront among the eleven engagement groups of g 20 academia civil society youth women our parliamentarians entrepreneurs and people associated with urban administration played an important role in one way or the other more than 1 5 crore people are

also paved the way for local to become global after the g 20 meeting in srinagar a huge increase in the number of tourists to kashmir is being seen i urge all countrymen to come together to make the g 20 summit successful and bring glory to the country my family members in episodes of mann ki baat we often discuss the potential of our young generation today sports is one area where our youth are continuously achieving new successes today in mann ki baat i will talk about a tournament where recently our players have raised the national flag a few days ago the world university games were held in china india displayed her best ever performance in these games this time our players won 26 medals in all out of which 11 were gold medals you will be pleased to know that even if we add all the medals won in all the world university games that have been held since 1959 this number reaches only 18 in all these decades just 18 whereas this time our players won 26 medals hence some young sportspersons students who have won medals in the world university games are currently connected with me on the phone line let me first tell you about them pragati a resident of up has won a medal in archery amlan a resident of assam has won a medal in athletics priyanka a resident of up has won a medal in race walk abhidanya a resident of maharashtra has won a medal in shooting modi ji namaskar

you first of all tell me what had you thought when you left after winning two medals and having achieved such a big victory what are you feeling pragati sir i was feeling very proud i was feeling so good that i had returned with my country s flag hoisted so high it is okay that once i had reached the gold fight i had lost it and was regretting it but the second time it was in my mind that if something happens now i will not let it lower down it has to flutter the highest in any situation when we won the fight at the end we celebrated very well on the same podium that moment was very good i was feeling so proud that i could not measure the feeling modi ji pragati you were facing a big problem physically you emerged out of that this in itself is a great inspiration for the youth of the country what had happened to you pragati sir on the 5th of may 2020 i had brain haemorrhage i was on the ventilator there was no surety whether i would survive or not and if at all how would i survive but certainly yes i had the inner courage that i have to go back to stand on the ground i have to shoot the arrow if my life has been saved then the biggest role is of god then doctor then archery modi ji amlan is also with us amlan tell me how you developed so much of interest in athletics amlan ji namaskar sir modi ji namaskar namaskar amlan sir earlier there was not much interest towards athletics earlier we were more into football but as my brother s friend told me that amlan you should go for athletics competitions so i thought okay so the first time i played the state meet i lost in it i didn t like the defeat so gradually i got into athletics then slowly now it is starting to be fun so just like that my interest grew modi ji amlan just tell me where did you practice mostly amlan mostly i have practiced in hyderabad under sai reddy sir then after that there was a shift to bhubaneswar and from there i started professionally sir ok priyanka is also with us priyanka you were part of the 20 kilometer race walk team the whole country is listening to you today and they want to know about this sport tell us what kind of skills are required for this and what has been the trajectory of your career priyanka in an event like mine it is very tough because there are five judges present even if we run they will expel us or even if we get off the road a little they will declare us out even if there is a jump or even if we bend our knees they expel us and i was even given a warning twice after that i controlled my speed so much since somehow i had to win the team medal at least from here because we have come here for the country and we do not want to leave empty handed modi ji yes and are father brother and others all fine priyanka yes sir everything is fine i tell everyone that you motivate us so much really sir i am feeling very good because there is not even a lot of demand for a game like world university in india it goes but now we are getting so much support in this game also we are seeing tweets everyone is tweeting that we have won so many medals so it is feeling very good that like olympics this too is getting so much of encouragement modi ji well priyanka congratulations from my side you have made a big name let us talk to abhidanya abhidanya namaste sir modi ji tell me about yourself abhidanya sir i am from kolhapur proper maharashtra i do both 25 metres sports pistol and 10 metres air pistol events in shooting both my parents are high school teachers and i started shooting in 2015 when i started shooting there were not that many facilities available in kolhapur it takes one and a half hour to travel from vadgaon to kolhapur by bus then one and a half hour to come back and four hours of training so like that 6 7 hours for travelling and training so i used to miss my school too then mummy papa said that beta do one thing we will take you to the shooting range on saturday sunday and the rest of the time you do other games so i used to play a lot of games in my childhood because both my parents were very much interested in sports but they could not do anything financial support was not that much and there was not that much of information available hence my mother had a big dream wanted me to represent the country and then win a medal for the country so to fulfil her dream i used to take a lot of interest in sports since childhood and then i have also done taekwondo in that too i am a black belt and after doing many games like boxing judo fencing and discus throw i came to shooting then i struggled a lot for 2 3 years and for the first time i got selected in malaysia for the university championship and i got bronze medal in that so i actually got a push from there then my school made a shooting range for me i used to train there and then they sent me to pune for training so there s gagan narang sports foundation gun for glory i am training under it now gagan sir has supported me a lot and encouraged me for my game modi ji well if all four of you want to say something to me i would like to hear it there should be pragati amlan priyanka and abhidanya all of you are connected with me so if you want to say something i will definitely listen amlan sir i have a question sir modi ji ji amlan which sport do you like best sir modi ji india should bloom a lot in the world of sports and that is why i am promoting these things a lot but hockey football kabaddi kho kho these are games rooted to our land in these we should never lag behind and i m observing that our people are doing well in archery they are doing well in shooting and secondly i am seeing that our youth and even in our families also do not have that feeling towards sports which was there earlier earlier when a child used to go to play they used to stop and now times have changed and the success that you people have been achieving motivates all the families in every game wherever our children are going they return after accomplishing something or the other for the country and such news is shown prominently in the country today is also conveyed and also discussed in schools and colleges well i felt very nice many many congratulations to all of you from my side many good wishes young player thank you very much thank you sir thank you modi ji thank you namaskar my family members this time on 15th august the country saw the power of sabka prayas the efforts of all the countrymen turned the har ghar tiranga abhiyan into a har man tiranga abhiyan many records were also made during this campaign the countrymen purchased tricolors in crores around 1 5 crore tricolors were sold through 1 5 lakh post offices through that our workers weavers and especially women have also earned hundreds of crores of rupees this time the countrymen have created a new record in posting selfie with the tricolor last year till august 15 about 5 crore countrymen had posted selfiewith the tricolor this year this number has also crossed 10 crores friends at present the campaign to evoke the spirit of patriotism meri mati mera desh is in full swing in the country in the month of september there will be a campaign to collect soil from every house in every village of the country the holy soil of the country will be deposited in thousands of amrit kalash urns at the end of october thousands will reach the country s capital delhi with the amrit kalash yatra amrit vatika will be built in delhi from this soil only i am sure the efforts of every countryman will make this campaign successful my family members this time i have received many letters in sanskrit language the reason for this is that the poornima of the month of sawan world sanskrit day is celebrated sarvebhyah vishwa sanskrit disasasya haardayaha shubhkamanah many felicitations to all of you on world sanskrit day we all know that sanskrit is one of the oldest languages in the world it is also called the mother of many modern languages sanskrit is known for its antiquity as well as its scientificity and grammar much ancient knowledge of india has been preserved in sanskrit language for thousands of years people doing research on subjects like yoga ayurveda and philosophy are now learning sanskrit more and more many institutes are also doing very good work in this direction such as sanskrit promotion foundation runs many courses like sanskrit for yog sanskrit for ayurveda and sanskrit for buddhism sanskrit bharti runs a campaign to teach sanskrit to people in this you can participate in a 10 day sanskrit conversation camp i am happy that today awareness and pride in sanskrit has increased among people there is also a special contribution of the country in the past years behind this for example three sanskrit deemed universities were made central universities in 2020 many colleges and institutes of sanskrit universities are also being run in different cities sanskrit centers are becoming very popular in institutes like iits and iims friends you must have often experienced one thing in order to connect with the roots to connect with our culture our tradition there s is a very powerful medium our mother tongue when we connect with our mother tongue we naturally connect with our culture we get connected with our sanskars we get connected with our tradition we get connected with our ancient splendor similarly india has another mother tongue the glorious telugu language 29 august will be celebrated as telugu day andariki telugu bhasha dinotsava shubhakankshalu many many congratulations to all of you on telugu day many priceless gems of indian culture are hidden in the literature and heritage of telugu language many efforts are also being made to ensure that the whole country gets the benefit of this heritage of telugu my family members we have talked about tourism in many episodes of mann ki baat seeing things or places in person understanding and living them for a few moments offers a different experience no matter how much someone describes the ocean we cannot feel its vastness without seeing the ocean no matter how much one talks about the himalayas we cannot assess its beauty without seeing the himalayas that s why i often urge all of you that whenever we get a chance we must go to see the beauty and diversity of our country often we also see one more thing despite having searched every corner of the world we are unaware of many best places and things in our own city or state many times it happens that people do not know much about the historical places of their own city something similar happened with dhanpal ji dhanapal ji used to work as a driver in the transport office of bangalore about 17 years ago he was given a responsibility in the sightseeing wing now people know it by the name of bengaluru darshini dhanpal ji used to take tourists to various tourist places of the city on one such trip a tourist asked him why the tank in bangalore is called senki tank he felt very bad that he did not know the answer in such a situation he focused on enhancing his own knowledge in his passion to know his heritage he found many stones and inscriptions dhanpal ji s mind was so absorbed in this task that he also did a diploma in epigraphy i e the subject related to inscriptions though he is now retired his passion to explore the history of bengaluru is still alive friends i am very happy to tell you about brian d kharpran he is a resident of meghalaya and has a great interest in speleology in simple language it means study of caves years ago this interest arose in him when he read several story books in 1964 he did his first exploration as a schoolboy in 1990 he along with his friend established an association and through this he started to find out about the unknown caves of meghalaya within no time he along with his team discovered more than 1700 caves in meghalaya and put the state on the world cave map some of the longest and deepest caves in india are present in meghalaya brian ji and his team have also documented the cave fauna ie those creatures of the cave which are not found anywhere else in the world i appreciate the efforts of this entire team as well as i urge you to make a plan to visit the caves of meghalaya my family members you all know that the dairy sector is one of the most important sectors of our country it has played a very important role in bringing a big change in the lives of our mothers and sisters just a few days ago i came to know about an interesting initiative of banas dairy of gujarat banas dairy is considered to be the biggest dairy in asia on an average 75 lakh liters of milk is processed here everyday after this it is also sent to other states for the timely delivery of milk here to other states until now the support of tankers or milk trains was availed of but there were no less challenges in that too firstly loading and unloading used to take a lot of time and often the milk also used to get spoilt to overcome this problem indian railways did a new experiment railways started a truck on track facility from palanpur to new rewari in this milk trucks are directly loaded onto the train that is the major problem of transportation has been overcome by this the results of the truck on track facility have been very satisfactory earlier the milk which used to take 30 hours to reach is now reaching in less than half the time due to this whereas the pollution caused by fuel has stopped the cost of fuel is also saved drivers of trucks have also benefited a lot from this their life has become easier friends with collective efforts today our dairies are also moving forward with modern thinking how banas dairy has also taken a step forward in the direction of environmental protection is evident through the seedball tree plantation campaign varanasi milk union is working on manure management to increase the income of our dairy farmers the effort of malabar milk union dairy of kerala is also very unique it is engaged in developing ayurvedic medicines for the treatment of animal diseases friends today there are many people who are diversifying by adopting dairy you must also know about amanpreet singh who is running a dairy farm in kota rajasthan along with dairy he also focused on biogas and set up two biogas plants due to this their expenditure on electricity has reduced by about 70 percent this effort of his is going to inspire dairy farmers across the country today many big dairies are focusing on biogas this type of community driven value addition is very exciting i am sure that such trends will continue throughout the country my family members that s all today in mann ki baat the season of festivals has also arrived happy raksha bandhan as well to all of you in advance at the time of celebration we also have to remember the mantra of vocal for local this campaign of atmanirbhar bharat is the every countryman s own campaign and during the festive atmosphere we have to keep holy places and their vicinity clean albeit for all times next time we will again have mann ki baat shall meet with some new topics we will discuss to our heart s

happiness than the humanity having a peaceful existence you are aware that i use a lot of technology which provides me lots of information i keep a watchful eye on my portal my gov mr ganesh v savleshwarkar has written to me from pune that this season is a tourist season a large number of foreign and domestic tourists travel across the country people also travel to celebrate christmas vacations he says most of the facilities related to tourism are catered to but special emphasis should be laid on cleanliness at all places which are tourist destinations or famed tourist places religious destinations or stay over s india s image will be enhanced if the tourist destinations are clean i appreciate the views of ganesh jee and convey this message to the people of our country we say atithi devo bhava and just imagine how we strive to keep our homes neat and clean when a guest is due to arrive in a similar manner the onus is on us to maintain our tourist destinations and pilgrim tourism sites neat and clean i am very happy that a lot of news stories related to cleanliness keep appearing in the media space from day one i have thanked our media friends since they have brought many such small and good success stories before the people i have come across a nice story in the newspaper and i would like to narrate it with the fellow citizens dileep singh malviya is an elderly artisan from bhojpura village in sehore district of madhya pradesh he is a mason by profession to earn his livelihood he did something so different that the newspapers printed his story and when it came to my notice i wanted to share this story with you hailing from a small village dileep singh malviya decided that if anyone provides materials for toilet in the village he will render his labour services free of cost and hats off to him he has constructed 100 toilets in bhojpura village so far taking it as a divine cause and providing his labour services without charging a penny my heartfelt congratulations to dileep singh malviya for his earnest efforts sometimes we hear disappointing news about our nation but there are thousands of people like dileep singh who are doing something good for the nation on their own this is the power of the nation this is the hope of the nation and these are the things which carry the nation forward and it is natural that we applaud dileep singh and his efforts in mann ki baat due to tireless efforts of many people the nation is making rapid progress 125 crores indians are not only marching together but they are taking the country forward too better education best talent and new opportunities of employment are being created be it providing insurance cover to citizens or providing them banking facilities be it the ease of doing business in the world horizon or making facilities available for new businesses we have done it all people from normal backgrounds who could not step inside banks can now avail loan facilities from the mudra yojana every indian is proud to know how the world is accepting and getting attracted towards yoga when the world celebrated international yoga diwas and the entire world got associated with it we became proud of our country such emotions arise when we see the enormity of our nation no one can forget the story of krishna and yashoda where he opened his mouth and the mother was able to see the entire universe and then only his power could be realized the yoga incident was a similar reminder the concept of cleanliness is being echoed in every household the participation of citizens is also increasing many villages receive an electric pole after so many years of independence those of us who live in cities and are so accustomed to using electricity that we don t realize the extent of happiness and excitement when darkness is removed from our lives the power department of the state and indian government were functional earlier as well but from the day 1000 day target to provide electricity to every village has been set we get news everyday that power supply is available in some or the other village and the happiness of the inhabitants knows no bounds the media has not discussed this topic but i am sure that media will definitely reach such villages and will inform the nation about the happiness and excitement of the people there the biggest achievement of this task is that the government officials involved in this task will have immense satisfaction that they have done something which will bring about such a big change in the lives of the people and the village itself be it the farmers poor young or women should such things reach them or not such news should reach them not to highlight any government s achievement but to make them aware of their rights they should not let go if it is their right people should get information in order to avail their rights we should all make efforts that right information good information and information useful to the common man should reach as many people as possible this is also a kind of service i too have tried to do this work from my end i cannot do everything alone by myself but if i am saying then i should at least do something even a common man can download the narendra modi app and get connected to me and i can share these small things with you through the app and it is a matter of happiness for me that people share all the things with me you too get connected with this initiative we have to reach 125 crore indians how will i reach without your help come let us collectively do such things of interest for the common man in their language and inspire them to avail things which are their rights my dear young friends i had some preliminary discussions about start up india stand up india in my speech on 15th august from the red fort after that all government departments started discussing it can india become a start up capital can our states work together for new start ups for youth and encourage innovations with start ups be it in the manufacturing sector service sector or agriculture everything should be new new ways and new thinking after all the world does not move ahead without innovation start up india stand up india brings in a huge opportunity for the young generation my dear young friends the government will launch the entire action plan for start up india stand up india on 16th january what it will be how it will be and why it will be you will be presented with a structure in this program all the iit s iim s central universities nit s wherever there is young generation they will be brought together via live connectivity there is an established thinking regarding the start ups that they are meant only for the digital world or the it profession this is not true at all we need to modify it according to the needs of india for example when a poor person works somewhere as a labourer and there is a lot of physical effort involved but if a young man innovates something which can reduce the physical effort and help the labourer i will call it as a start up i will ask the bank to help such an individual and i will tell him to move ahead with courage you will get the market similarly is the intellectual wealth limited to a few selected cities or what this thinking is wrong the indian youth all over the country has talent all they need is opportunities this start up india stand up india should not be limited to a few cities only it should spread to every corner of india and i will request the state governments to take this forward i will definitely interact with you on 16th january and will discuss this in detail your suggestions are always welcome dear young friends 12th january is the birth anniversary of swami vivekananda there are thousands like me who draw inspiration from him since 1995 12th january the birth anniversary of vivekananda is celebrated as the national youth festival this year it will be organized from 12 16th january in raipur district of chhattisgarh this is a theme based event and i have got the information that this time they have a very good theme and that is indian youth on development skill and harmony i have been told that 10 000 young people will gather from all over india a mini india will be created there they will share dreams together a feeling of determination will be experienced can you give me suggestions regarding this youth festival i would request the youth to send me their suggestions directly on the narendra modi app i want to gain an insight into your understanding and that it gets reflected in the youth festival for that i will give the government reasonable suggestions and information so i will wait dear friends for your suggestions on the youth festival on the narendra modi app dilip chauhan from ahmedabad gujarat who is a visually challenged teacher celebrated accessible india day in his school he called me up to express his feelings sir we celebrated accessible india campaign in our school i am a visually challenged teacher and i addressed 2000 children on the issue of disability and how we can spread awareness and help differently abled people and the students response was fantastic we enjoyed in the school and the students were inspired and motivated to help the disabled people in the society i think it was a great initiative by you dilip ji thank you very much you are yourself working in this field you understand everything and you must have faced a lot of difficulties too sometimes when we meet someone with different ability in the society then a lot of things come to our mind we express our perception of him based on our thinking there are some people who lose a limb or body part in an accident some people are born with some defects and for these people different terms are used and a lot of thought goes on behind the usage of these terms all the time people feel that this kind of identification does not sound nice and respectable at some point we heard handicapped then it was disabled and somewhere it is specially abled so many terms have been used it is true that words have their own significance this year when the government of india started the sugamya india programme i was supposed to attend it but could not make it because of severe floods in chennai and other areas of tamil nadu however since i had to attend that program some thoughts kept coming in my mind that time i thought that we call or know those people as handicapped since they are lacking in some ways in terms of their body structure or whose organs do not function properly however at times when we interact with them we realize that we see only the deficits with our eyes but god has certainly bestowed them with some extra powers god has bestowed upon them some different power which we cannot see with our eyes but it is only when we see them working do we realize their talent we think o great look how he works so i thought that upon looking at them with our eyes we feel that they are handicapped but experiences tell us that they have some extra power so i thought why not use the term divyang instead of viklang in our country they are those people who have one or more such organs which have divinity where divine power flows which we normal bodied people do not have i like this term my dear countrymen can we make it a habit to use the word divyang and make it popular i hope that you will take this forward that day we started the sugamya bharat campaign under this campaign we will improve both the physical and virtual infrastructure and make it accessible for the divyang people be it schools hospitals government offices bus depots railway stations everywhere ramps accessible parking accessible lifts braille many amenities will be made available to make things sugamya we need innovation we need technology we need systems and we also need empathy from people we have taken the initiative we are receiving public participation too people like it you too can join in the manner you deem fit my dear countrymen the government schemes will continue exist and run but it is necessary that these schemes always remain operational the schemes should be operational till the last mile individual has benefitted from them they should not have a dead existence in government files after all these schemes are meant for common man the poor people in the past few days the government has made an effort to ensure that the benefits of schemes reach out to the rightful owners in our country we give subsidy for the gas cylinders crores of rupees were spent on it but we did not know if it reached the right people or not if this subsidy reached people on time or not the government has made some changes in the scheme the government undertook the largest direct benefit transfer scheme to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries with the help of jan dhan account or aadhar card etc i am happy to share with the countrymen that this scheme has earned a place in guinness book of world records as the largest direct benefit transfer scheme which has been implemented successfully this scheme is known as pahal and this experiment has been very successful till november end around 15 crore lpg customers have become its beneficiaries the government money is being directly transferred to the accounts of 15 crore beneficiaries no middlemen nor any recommendation nor any possibility of corruption on one hand was the aadhar card scheme and on the other was the jan dhan account thirdly the state and indian government compiled the lists of beneficiaries that was connected to account and aadhar this work is still in progress nowadays even the mnrega scheme which provides employment opportunities in villages is being connected to it there were lots of complaints about this scheme in many places the wages of the labourers is now being directly transferred into their accounts there were complaints about student scholarships too they too are being transferred into their accounts this has been started and will be gradually taken forward till now around 40 000 crore rupees are directly reaching the beneficiaries through various schemes according to my rough estimate around 35 40 schemes are now under direct benefit transfer my dear countrymen 26th january is the golden moment in the life of indian democracy this is a beautiful co incidence that baba saheb ambedkar the maker of the indian constitution his 125th birth anniversary will be celebrated this year we organized a two day special discussion on the constitution and it was a very good experience all the parties and all the members deliberated on the sanctity of the constitution its importance to understand the true interpretation of the constitution it was an excellent discussion we should take this thing forward can republic day be an opportunity to connect the masses with the system our constitution grants us several rights and there are many discussions on it and it should be so and it is equally important but constitution equally emphasizes on duty also but it is seen that duties are hardly discussed at the most whenever there are elections then we see advertisement all around us they write on the walls and hoardings are put to tell that to vote is our sacred duty there is a lot of talk about duties during elections but why not discuss our duties in general life too this year when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of babasaheb ambedkar then can we make 26th january a medium to organize debates poetry slogan competition regarding duties in our own schools colleges villages cities and various organizations and societies if 125 crore indians take dutiful steps one after the other they can make history but at least let s start with discussions i have an idea send me an essay or poem before 26th january about duty in hindi or english or your native language can you send me i want to know your views send them on my portal my gov i would like to know what my young generation thinks about their duties i want to give a small suggestion on 26th january we celebrate republic day can we citizens and school and college students take up the initiative of cleaning the statue of any great men installed in our city of cleaning the premises we can do best of cleanliness and best of decoration on the occasion of 26th january and i am not saying this on government lines we become so emotional about getting the statues of great men erected but become equally complacent when it comes to maintaining them as a society as a nation can we make it a natural tendency to respect the statues of our great men on this 26th january let us make an effort that we will respect such great men and keep the premises clean but this should be done by the citizens willfully dear countrymen greetings to you for a happy new year 2016 thank you very much ,India is land of diversities we celebrate a whole lot of festivals one is not done with one festival in the mean time the second one comes along in a way one festival leaves us waiting for another at times it feels india is one such country which has a festival driven economy it becomes a source of the economic activities for even the poor sections of the society greetings from my end for a merry christmas to all indians and i also wish you all a happy new year may 2016 usher in lots of joys in your lives i appreciate the views of ganesh jee and convey this message to the people of our country we say atithi devo bhava and just imagine how we strive to keep our homes neat and clean when a guest is due to arrive
27-Dec-20,"In his final ""Mann Ki Baat"" of 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared various inspiring stories and ideas. He emphasized the nation's collective strength and the spirit of self-reliance that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. People are increasingly supporting Indian-made products, marking a significant shift in consumer preferences. The Prime Minister urged manufacturers to maintain product quality and meet global standards while emphasizing the ""vocal for local"" initiative. He paid tribute to historical sacrifices for India's culture and traditions and highlighted the rising leopard population in the country. He commended people's compassionate efforts toward animals, the preservation of regional cultures, and the importance of inquisitiveness and lifelong learning. The Prime Minister also spoke about the recently awarded Geographical Indication (GI) tag for Kashmiri saffron and encouraged its use. He cited the Gita as a source of wisdom that starts with curiosity and applauded a 92-year-old scholar who learned to use a computer to write books. Modi commended citizens engaged in cleaning campaigns in the Himalayas and a newlywed couple in Karnataka who, instead of going on a honeymoon, cleaned up a beach. He urged the public to embrace the resolution of making India free from single-use plastic in 2021.",27-dec-2020 my dear countrymen namaskar today is the 27th of december just four days later 2021 is about to usher in in a way today s mann ki baat is the concluding mann ki baat of 2020 the next mann ki baat will commence in 2021 friends numerous letters written by you are there in front of me the suggestions you sent on mygov too are there many have expressed themselves over the phone most of the messages comprise experiences of the year gone by and resolutions for 2021 anjali from kolhapur has written that on new year we offer greetings and good wishes to others let us do something novel this time why don t we greet our country send best wishes to the country too may our country touch newer heights in 2021 may india s image in the world strengthen further what could be a greater wish than this friends abhishek from mumbai has posted a message on namo app he has written that whatever 2020 revealed to us taught us was unthinkable he has written on myriad aspects of corona in these letters in these messages one common special factor that comes across to me is something that i would like to share with you in most of the letters people have commended the country s capabilities and the collective strength of the countrymen when a novel experiment such as janta curfew became an inspiration for the whole world when the country felicitated our corona warriors unitedly with taali thali the applause and the reverberating chime of plates people have sent in reminiscences of that too friends the most common amongst the common folk of the country has felt this transformation i have witnessed an extraordinary ripple of hope in the country there came multiple challenges many a crisis on account of corona the world faced numerous hurdles in terms of supply chains but we learn a new lesson with every crisis the country was blessed with newer capabilities putting it into words this capacity is termed as atmanirbharta self reliance friends the experience that abhinav banerjee from delhi has written to me is very interesting too abhinav ji wanted to buy some toys and gifts for children in the family hence he had gone to jhandewalan market in delhi many of you might be aware that this market in delhi is known for bicycles and toys earlier even expensive toys there would mean imported ones cheaper toys too would come in from elsewhere too but abhinav ji has mentioned in his letter that many shopkeepers are selling toys to customers emphasizing on the quality saying those are better toys since they are made in india customers too are demanding india made toys indeed this is it a big transformation in the mindset this is living proof of the same a huge change has begun in the minds of our countrymen that too within a year it is not easy to gauge this change even economists would not be able to assess it on their parameters friends what venkat murli prasad from vishakhapatnam has written to me also contains an idea of an entirely different kind venkatji has written that he is attaching for me his abc for 2021 i could not understand what he meant by abc then i saw that venkatji has attached a chart along with the letter i glanced at the chart and realised what he meant by abc atmanirbhar bharat chart this is very interesting venkatji has prepared a list of all those items that he uses on a daily basis it comprises electronics stationery self care items besides many other things venkat ji has said that knowingly or unknowingly we are using those foreign products whose substitutes are easily available in india he has now vowed that he would use only that product that bears the mark of our countrymen s toil and sweat friends but along with this he has also referred to something which i found pretty interesting he has written that while we are supporting a self reliant india there should be a clear message for our manufacturers that they should not compromise on the quality of the products what he says is right this is the opportune moment to work with the ethos of zero effect zero defect i urge manufacturers and industry leaders of the country people of the country have taken a firm step moving a bold step forward vocal for local is reverberating in each and every household in such a scenario it is time to ensure that our products meet global standards whatever is global best we should make it in india and prove it for that our entrepreneur friends have to come forward startups too have to come forth once again i congratulate venkatji on his stellar effort friends we have to cherish this sentiment preserve it and keep nurturing it as well i have said this earlier too i once again urge countrymen do prepare a list whatever items we use throughout the day analyse them think of things manufactured abroad that have permeated into our lives unknowingly in a way shackling us down let us find out their substitutes made in india and decide that henceforth we shall use products made with the hard work and sweat of the people of india you make new year resolutions every year this time one has to certainly make a resolution for the sake of the country my dear countrymen in order to protect our millennia old culture civilization and traditions from the cruel misdemeanors of tyrants tormentors many a supreme sacrifice was made it is a day to remember them too on this day the sons of guru gobind singh sahibzade zorawar singh and fateh singh were immured alive the tyrants wanted sahibzade to renounce their faith abandon the teachings of the great guru tradition but our sahibzade showed amazing courage and determination even at that tender age during the immurement as stones began piling up gradually raising the height of the wall death staring into the face despite that they did not budge even a bit it was on this day itself that guru gobind singhji s mother mata gujari attained martyrdom about a week ago it was the martyrdom day of shri guru tegh bahadurji too here in delhi i was blessed with the opportunity to visit gurudwara rakabganj to offer floral tributes and pay my obeisance to guru tegh bahadurji during this very month inspired by shri guru gobind singhji many people sleep on the floor people reminisce the supreme sacrifices made by family members of shri guru gobind singhji with immense reverence this martyrdom served as a new beacon of learning for entire humanity for the country this martyrdom served towards the great deed of protecting our civilisation we are indebted to this martyrdom once again i bow to the martyrdom of shri guru tegh bahadur ji mata gujari guru gobind singhji and the four sahibzade several such sacrifices have preserved the present fabric of india keeping it intact my dear countrymen i am now going to tell you something that will gladden you and make you feel proud as well in india between 2014 and 2018 the number of leopards has risen by more than 60 percent in 2014 the number of leopards in the country was about 7 900 whereas in 2019 it increased to 12 852 these are the very leopards about which jim corbett had said those who have not seen a leopard wandering free in nature cannot imagine its beauty cannot visualize the beauty of its colors and the charm of its gait in most parts of the country especially central india the number of leopards has risen amongst the states with the maximum population of leopards madhya pradesh karnataka and maharashtra are topmost in the order this is a big achievement for the year leopards across the world have been facing dangers their habitat has faced loss in the entire world in such circumstances the continued growth of the population of leopards in india has shown a way to the entire world you must also be aware that in the past few years the population of lions in india has risen the number of tigers too has increased also there has been an increase in india s forest area the reason for this is that not only the government but also many people civil society many institutions too are engaged in conserving our trees and plants and wild animals they all deserve accolades friends i read about a heart touching effort at coimbatore in tamilnadu you too must have seen visuals of this on social media we have seen wheelchairs for humans but daughter gayatri in coimbatore along with her father made a wheelchair for a suffering dog this sensitivity is inspiring and can happen only when a person is filled with kindness and compassion towards all life forms in delhi ncr and other cities of the country in the chilling cold many people are doing a lot for the care of shelterless animals they arrange for food water sweaters and even beds for those animals some people arrange food for hundreds of such animals every day such efforts should be commended several noble efforts are being undertaken in kaushambi uttar pradesh there prison inmates are making covers from old and torn blankets to protect cows from the cold besides kaushambi these blankets are collected from jails of other districts and then they are sewn and sent to gaushaalas cow shelters prisoners of kaushambi are sewing several covers every week come let us encourage such acts of care with a sense of service to others in fact this is a noble act that strengthens the sensitivity of the society my dear countrymen the letter that is in front of me now bears two large photographs these are photos of a temple and depict before and after the letter which is with these photos talks about a team of youth which calls itself yuva brigade in fact this youth brigade has transformed an ancient shiva temple named veerbhadra swami in srirangpatna in karnataka all around in the temple there were widespread weeds and shrubs so much that even travelers could not have recognized the existence of a temple there one day some tourists posted a video of this forgotten temple on social media when the yuva brigade saw this video on social media they could not bear it and this team decided to renovate it together they removed the thorny bushes grass and plants that had come up in the compound of the temple they did repair and construction wherever required seeing their good deed the local people too extended a helping hand some offered cement others offered paint people came up with many other such contributions all these youths belong to different professions hence they took out time during weekends and worked for the temple they arranged for electricity connection too for the temple besides getting doors installed thus restoring the old grandeur of the temple passion and firm commitment are two means through which people can achieve every goal when i see the youth of india i feel delighted and assured delighted and assured because the youth of my country has the can do approach and the will do spirit in them no challenge is too big for them nothing is out of reach for them i read about a teacher from tamil nadu her name is hemalata n k and she teaches the oldest language of the world tamil at a school in viddupuram even the covid 19 pandemic could not create hurdles in her teaching work yes challenges definitely were there but she found out an innovative way she recorded all the 53 chapters of the course created animated videos put them in a pen drive and distributed that amongst her students her students got a lot of help from this they understood the chapters visually along with this she kept interacting with her students telephonically thus studies became quite interesting for the students all over the country during this corona time the innovative methods that the teachers have adopted the course material they have creatively prepared is invaluable in this period of online studies i request all the teachers to definitely upload these course materials on the diksha portal of the education ministry this will help students who are staying in far flung areas of the country a lot friends let us now talk of hiramanji of korwa tribe of jharkhand hiramanji lives in the sinjo village of garhwa district you will be amazed to know that the population of korwa tribe is merely 6 000 which lives in hills and forests far away from cities hiramanji has taken up the task of preserving the culture and identity of his community after an untiring toil of 12 years he has created a dictionary of the korwa language which is getting extinct in this dictionary he has written with meanings many korwa words right from words used in the household to words used in daily life what hiramanji has done for the korwa community is an example for the country my dear countrymen it is said that there was a prominent courtier in the court of akbar named abulfazl after a visit to kashmir he once remarked that the place had one such scenic view that could uplift the mood of the most irritable and bad tempered people making them rejoice in fact he was referring to the saffron fields in kashmir saffron has been associated with kashmir for centuries kashmiri saffron is mainly grown in places like pulwama budgam and kishtwar in may this year the kashmiri saffron was given the geographical indication tag or gi tag through this we want to make kashmiri saffron a globally popular brand kashmiri saffron is globally famous as a spice that has many medicinal properties it has a strong aroma its color is deep dark and its threads are long and thick which enhances its medicinal value it represents the rich cultural heritage of jammu and kashmir and if you re talking about the quality the saffron of kashmir is unique and completely different from the saffron of other countries saffron from kashmir has now got a distinct identity with the gi tag recognition you will be delighted to know that after obtaining the gi tag certificate kashmiri saffron was launched in a supermarket in dubai now its exports will get a boost this will further strengthen our efforts to build an atmanirbhar bharat farmers growing saffron will be especially benefited by this now take a look at the case of abdul majeedwani a resident of shar area of tral in pulwama he is selling his gi tagged saffron with the help of national saffron mission at the trading center in pampore through e trading many people like him are involved in this activity in kashmir next time you decide to buy saffron think of buying saffron from kashmir only the warmth of kashmiri people is such that it imparts a unique distinct flavor to the saffron my dear countrymen just two days ago was geeta jayanti gita inspires us in every context of our life but have you ever thought why is geeta such a wonderful granth that is because it is the voice of lord krishna himself but the uniqueness of the gita also lies in that it begins with the quest of knowledge starts with a question arjuna asked the lord a question inquired and only then the world received the wisdom of gita like the gita all the wisdom in our culture starts with inquisitiveness the very first mantra of vedanta is athaato brahm jigyasa that is come let us inquire about brahm that is why we talk about the inquest of even brahm the ultimate creator such is the power of inquisitiveness curiosity constantly inspires you to learn something new in childhood we learn only because we are curious that is we are alive as long as there is curiosity in us as long as there is curiosity the process of learning something new continues no age no circumstance matters at all in this i came to know of an example of such energy of inquisitiveness about shri t srinivasacharya swami ji an elderly person from tamil nadu shri t srinivasacharya swami ji is ninety two years old even at this age he is writing his book on the computer that too typing himself you must be thinking that writing a book is fine but in the times of srinivasacharyaji there were no computers so when did he learn the computer it is right that there was no computer during his college days but there still is as much curiosity in his mind and self confidence as it was in his youth in fact srinivasacharya swamiji is a scholar of sanskrit and tamil he has written about 16 spiritual books so far however with the advent of the computer when he realized that the method of writing and printing books had changed he learned the computer and necessary software at the age of 86 yes at the age of eighty six now he is completing his book friends shri t srinivasacharya swamiji s life is a living example of the fact that life remains full of energy as long as the curiosity in life the desire to learn does not die hence we should never think that we lagged behind we missed only if we too had learnt this we should not even think that we cannot learn or cannot move forward my dear countrymen we were just talking about learning and doing something new out of inquisitiveness we were also referring to new resolutions in the new year but there are also some people who continuously keep on doing something new keep on fulfilling new resolves you too must have felt in life that when we do something for society the society itself gives us energy to do a lot of things significant deeds can be accomplished with seemingly simple motivations one such youth is shriman pradeedp sangwan gurugram s pradeep sangwan has been running a campaign healing himalayas since 2016 he goes to different areas in the himalayas with his team and volunteers where they clean plastic waste dumped there by tourists so far pradeep ji has cleaned tons of plastic from various tourist locations in the himalayas similarly there is a young couple from karnataka anudeep and minusha anudeep and minusha got married just last month in november a lot of young people go for a trip after marriage but these two did something different both of them always saw that people go out on a trip but wherever they go they leave a lot of garbage and waste behind a similar situation was prevailing at the someshwar beach in karnataka anudeep and minusha decided that they would clean up the garbage that people have left behind at the someshwar beach this was the first resolve that both husband and wife took after marriage together they cleaned up a lot of garbage from the beach anudeep also shared about his resolve on social media inspired by his magnanimous thought a number of young people came and joined him you will be surprised to know that together these people have cleaned more than 800 kg of waste from someshwar beach friends amidst these efforts we also have to think that this garbage gets on these beaches these mountains in the first place after all it is one among us only who leaves this garbage there we should run a cleanliness drive like pradeep and anudeep minusha but even before that we should also take a resolve that we will not leave garbage at all to begin with after all this is also the first resolution of the clean india campaign and yes i want to remind you of something more due to corona this year it could not be discussed much we have to make our country free from single use plastic this is also one of the resolutions of 2021 in conclusion i extend my best wishes to you for the new year stay healthy yourself keep your family healthy too next year in january mann ki baat will touch upon new subjects many thanks the final mannkibaat of 2020 and as usual a lot of letters inputs and thoughts have been shared people have been sharing how the year went people have paid tributes

full vigour mannkibaat ,"In his final ""Mann Ki Baat"" of 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared various inspiring stories and ideas.

welcome to mann ki baat once again today we will commence mann ki baat mentioning india s success in the beginning of this month india has been successful in bringing home an invaluable heritage of hers from italy this heritage is the over one thousand years old idol of avalokiteshvara padmapani this idol was stolen a few years ago from kundalpur temple devi sthan of gaya ji in bihar but after innumerable efforts india has now got this idol back similarly a few years ago the idol of lord anjaneyaar hanuman ji was stolen from vellore in tamil nadu this idol of hanuman ji was also 600 700 years old earlier this month we retrieved this in australia our mission has received it friends in our history of thousands of years idols one better than the other were always being made in various parts of the country it also comprised reverence capability skill and was full of varied diversity and the history of each of our idols also depicts the influence of their respective times not only were they a wonderful artistic example of indian sculpture our faith was also connected with them but in the past many idols were stolen and kept being taken out of india sometimes in this country at times in another these idols were sold and for them they were just pieces of art neither did they have anything to do with their history nor with reverence attached to them it is our responsibility towards mother india to bring home these idols these idols embody a part of the soul of india faith as well they also have a cultural historical significance realising this responsibility india increased her efforts and resultantly it fostered a deterrent fear against the tendency to steal the countries where these idols were stolen and taken away to also started to feel now that it could also have immense significance in the diplomatic channel of soft power in relations with india india s feelings are associated with it india s reverence is attached as well and in a way it creates a lot of strength in people to people relations as well just a few days ago you must have noted that the idol of ma annapurna devi which was stolen from kashi was also brought back this is an example of the changing global outlook towards india till the year 2013 nearly 13 idols had been brought back to india but in the last seven years india has successfully brought back more than 200 precious idols many countries such as america britain holland france canada germany singapore have understood this sentiment of india and helped us to retrieve these idols when i went to america in september last year i came across a lot of very old idols and many artefacts of cultural importance there whenever any priceless heritage returns to the country it is naturally a matter of great satisfaction for all of us as an indian as one who has reverence for history and archaeology one connected with faith and culture friends talking about indian culture and our heritage today i want to introduce you to two people in mann ki baat these days two tanzanian siblings kili paul and his sister nima are in the news a lot on facebook twitter and instagram and i m sure you too must have heard about them they have a passion a craze for indian music and for this reason they are also very popular their technique of lip sync shows how hard they work at it recently a video of him singing our national anthem jana gana mana on the occasion of republic day went viral a few days ago he also paid a soulful tribute to lata didi by presenting her song i really appreciate these two siblings kili and nima very much for their wonderful creativity a few days ago he has also been honoured at the indian embassy in tanzania the magic of indian music is such that it fascinates everyone i recall a few years ago singers musicians from more than one hundred and fifty countries of the world in their respective countries in their respective costumes made a successful presentation of vaishnav jan the beloved bhajan of revered bapu the favourite composition of mahatma gandhi today when india is celebrating the important festival of 75th year of its independence similar initiatives can be carried out regarding patriotic songs wherein foreign nationals or famous singers from abroad are invited to render indian patriotic songs not only this if kili and neema in tanzania can lip sync the songs of india in this manner aren t there many types of songs in my country in many languages of our country can t any gujarati children do that with tamil songs some children of kerala could do that with assamese songs some kannada children could that with songs of jammu and kashmir we can create such an environment in which we will be able to experience ek bharat shreshtha bharat not only this we can definitely celebrate azadi ka amrit mahotsav in a novel way i urge the youth of the country to make videos of the popular songs of indian languages in their own way you will become very popular and the diversity of the country will be introduced to the new generation my dear countrymen just a few days ago we celebrated international mother language day those who are learned can give a lot of academic input about where the word mother tongue came from how it originated i would emphasise about mother tongue that as our mother moulds our life in the same manner mother tongue also shapes our life the mother and mother tongue both together strengthen the foundation of life lending it permanence just like we cannot abandon our mother similarly we cannot leave our mother tongue either i remember an incident of yesteryears when i had gone to america i would get a chance to visit different families once i went to a telugu family and i got to see a very happy scenario there they told me that they had made a rule in the family that no matter how busy one were to be if they were not outstation then all the family members would have dinner sitting at the table together and equally compulsory on the dinner table was conversing in telugu language only this was also the rule for the children who were born there seeing this love for the mother tongue i was highly impressed by this family friends even after 75 years of independence some people are facing a mental dilemma due to which they have reservations with regard to their language their dress their food and drink whereas it is not like this anywhere else in the world it is our mother tongue we should speak it with pride and our india is so rich in terms of languages that it just cannot be compared the biggest beauty of our languages is that from kashmir to kanyakumari from kutch to kohima hundreds of languages thousands of dialects which are different from each other but are mutually integrated many languages one expression for centuries our languages have been evolving whilst learning from each other and have been refining themselves developing each other the world s oldest language tamil is in india and every indian should be proud that we have such a significant heritage of the world in the same way many ancient scriptures are also there their expression too is in our sanskrit language the people of india are proud to be associated with 121 forms of mother tongues and 14 of these languages are spoken by more than 1 crore people in everyday life that is many european countries do not have a total population than the people who are associated with 14 different languages in our country in the year 2019 hindi was ranked third among the most spoken languages of the world every indian should be proud of this too language is not just a medium of expression but also serves to preserve the culture and heritage of the society surjan parohi ji is doing similar work in suriname to save the heritage of his language he turned 84 on the 2nd of this month his forefathers also went to suriname years ago along with thousands of workers to earn a living surjan parohi ji writes very good poetry in hindi his name is considered among the national poets there that is even today hindustan beats in his heart there is a fragrance of the soil of india in his works the people of suriname have also built a museum in the name of surjan parohi ji it is very heartening for me that in the year 2015 i had the opportunity to honour him friends today that is 27th february is also marathi bhasha gaurav divas this day is dedicated to marathi kaviraj vishnu vaman shirvadkar ji shriman kusumagraj ji today is also the birth anniversary of kusumagraj ji kusumagraj ji wrote poems in marathi wrote many plays and took marathi literature to new heights friends our languages have their own special characteristics mother tongue has its own science for understanding this science emphasis has been laid on studies in the local language in the national education policy efforts are being made that our professional courses should also be taught in the regional languages in azadi ka amrit kaal we all should lend momentum to this effort together this is a work indicative of self respect i would like you to know about the qualities of whatever mother tongue you speak and write something in it friends a few days ago i had a meeting with my friend and former prime minister of kenya raila odinga this meeting was interesting but also very emotional since we are very good friends we also discuss freely while both of us were in a conversation odinga ji told about his daughter his daughter rosemary had a brain tumour and because of this she had to undergo surgery however one side effect of this was that rosemary almost lost her eyesight she stopped seeing you can imagine what must have happened to the daughter and we can also guess the condition of the father we can understand his feelings in hospitals all over the world there was not any major country in the world where he had not tried his best for the treatment of his daughter he searched the big countries of the world but there was no success and in a way giving up all hopes there was an atmosphere of despair in the entire household meanwhile someone suggested him to come to india for ayurveda treatment and even though he had tried a lot and was tired yet he thought that let s try once again see what happens he came to india started getting his daughter treated at an ayurvedic hospital in kerala the daughter stayed here for a long time the effect of this ayurvedic treatment was such that rosemary s eyesight returned to a great extent you can imagine as if a new lease of life was given and light came back into rosemary s life as the new light has come in the whole family odinga ji was so emotional while telling me this and that he wishes that the knowledge and science of ayurveda of india should be brought to kenya the type of plants that are used in it will be cultivated by them and he will do his best to get more people to benefit from it it is a matter of great happiness for me that from our land and our tradition have alleviated such a great suffering from someone s life you will also be happy to hear this which indian would not be proud of it we all know that not only odinga ji but lakhs of people across the world are reaping similar benefits from ayurveda prince charles from britain is also one of the big admirers of ayurveda whenever i meet him he definitely mentions ayurveda he is also aware of many ayurvedic institutions of india friends in the last seven years a lot of attention has been paid to the promotion of ayurveda in the country the formation of the ministry of ayush has further strengthened our resolve to popularise our traditional methods of medicine and health i am very happy that in the last few years many new start ups have emerged in the field of ayurveda the ayush start up challenge started earlier this month the goal of this challenge is to identify and support the start ups working in this field i urge the youth working in this field that they should take part in this challenge friends once people are determined to do something together they do wonderful things there have been many such big changes in the society in which public participation collective effort has played a significant role one such mass movement named mission jal thal is underway in srinagar kashmir this is a unique effort to clean the lakes and ponds of srinagar and restore their old glory the focus of mission jal thal is on kushal saar and gil saar along with public participation a lot of help of technology is also being taken in this to find out where there has been encroachment where illegal construction has taken place a formal survey of this area was carried out along with this a campaign to remove plastic waste and clean up the waste was also launched in the second phase of the mission a lot of effort was also made to restore the old water channels and 19 springs filling the lake in order to spread more and more awareness about the importance of this restoration project local people and youth were also made water ambassadors now the local people here are also taking efforts for increasing the number of migratory birds and fish in gil saar lake and are also happy to see it my heartiest congratulations to the people of srinagar for this wonderful effort friends the clean india mission started by the country eight years ago with the passage of time it expanded manifold new innovations were also added wherever you go in india you will find that some effort is being made for cleanliness everywhere i have come to know about one such attempt in kokrajhar assam here a group of morning walkers have taken a very commendable initiative under the clean and green kokrajhar mission all of them gave a motivational message of cleanliness by cleaning the three kilometre long road in the new flyover area similarly under the clean india campaign in visakhapatnam cloth bags are being promoted instead of polythene people here are also campaigning against single use plastic products to keep the environment clean along with this these people are also spreading awareness to segregate the waste at home the students of somaiya college in mumbai have also included beautification in their campaign of cleanliness they have decorated the walls of kalyan railway station with beautiful paintings an inspiring example from sawai madhopur in rajasthan has also come to my notice the youth here have started a campaign named mission beat plastic in ranthambore in which plastic and polythene have been removed from the forests of ranthambore this spirit of sabka prayas everyone s effort strengthens public participation in the country and when there is public participation even the biggest goals are definitely met my dear countrymen just a few days from today international women s day will be celebrated all over the world on 8th of march we have been sharing many examples related to the courage skill and talent of women in mann ki baat today whether it is skill india self help group small or big industries women have taken the lead everywhere wherever you see women are dispelling old myths today in our country from parliament to panchayat women are reaching newer heights in different fields in the army too daughters are now playing responsibilities in new and bigger roles and are protecting the country last month on republic day we saw that daughters were flying modern fighter planes too the country also lifted the restrictions on the admission of daughters in sainik schools and daughters are taking admission in sainik schools all over the country similarly look at the start up world in the recent years thousands of new start ups began in the country about half of these start ups have women in director roles in the recent past decisions like increasing maternity leave for women have been taken the country is trying to give equal rights to sons and daughters by fixing a common age for marriage due to this the participation of women is increasing in every field you must be noticing another major change happening in the country this change is the success of our social campaigns take the success of beti bachao beti padhao today the sex ratio in the country has improved the number of girls going to school has also improved in this we also have a responsibility that our daughters do not drop out of school similarly women in the country have got freedom from open defecation under the swachh bharat abhiyan a social evil like triple talaq is also coming to an end ever since the law against triple talaq has come into being there has been a reduction of 80 percent in triple talaq cases in the country how are all these changes happening in such a short span of time this change is coming because women themselves are now leading the change and progressive efforts in our country my dear countrymen tomorrow the 28th of february is national science day this day is also known for the discovery of raman effect along with cv raman ji i pay my respectful tribute to all the scientists who have contributed significantly in enriching our scientific journey friends technology has secured an important place in our lives in the realm of ease and simplicity which technology is good and what is the better use of that technology we are well acquainted with all these subjects but it is also true that the basis of that technology the underlying science is something that we neglect in conveying to the children of our family on this science day i urge all the families to definitely start with small efforts to develop a scientific temperament in their children now for example poor vision after wearing glasses vision improves with clarity children can easily be explained on the science behind it it s not that one should restrict oneself to just looking at the glasses and enjoying now you can simply explain to the child on a small piece of paper now the child uses a mobile phone how does a calculator work how does a remote control work what are sensors along with this are such scientific elements also discussed in the house maybe we can easily explain these things behind the everyday functioning of the household what is the inherent science behind a phenomenon in the same way have we ever indulged in stargazing together with the children there must have been conversations about stars in the night different constellations appear tell them about them by doing this you can create a new interest in children towards physics and astronomy nowadays there are also many apps through which you can locate the stars and planets or you can identify the star which is visible in the sky and can also know about it i will also tell our start ups that you should employ your skills and scientific character in the work related to nation building this is also our collective scientific responsibility towards the country like nowadays i see that our start ups are doing very well in the world of virtual reality in this era of virtual classes one such virtual lab can be designed keeping children in mind we can also make children experience a chemistry lab sitting at home through virtual reality my request to my teachers and parents is to encourage all the students and children to ask questions and together with them find the right answers to those questions today i would also like to appreciate the role of indian scientists in the fight against corona due to their hard work it was possible to manufacture the made in india vaccine which has helped the whole world a lot this is the gift of science to humanity my dear countrymen this time too we discussed many subjects many festivals are lined up in the coming month of march shivratri a few days later we will all will start preparing for holi holi is a festival that unites us all in this festival all differences between near dear ones and strangers big and small rancour and envy disappear that is why it is said that the colours of love and harmony are thicker than the colours of holi along with gujiya in holi there is a unique sweetness of relationships as well we have to strengthen these bonds further and relations are not only with the people of our family but also with the people who are part of your larger family you have to remember the most important way to do so this is the way of celebrating the festival through vocal for local you should buy local products on festivals so that the lives of the people living around you also become colourful and vibrant the success with which our country is fighting the battle against corona and moving forward is imparting enthusiasm to the festivals manifold with this very zeal we have to celebrate our festivals and at the same time we have to maintain our caution i wish you all a very happy festival season i will always be waiting for your words your letters and your messages thank you very much tune in to mannkibaat february 2022 india has been successful in bringing back invaluable artifacts mannkibaat till the year 2013 nearly 13 idols had been brought back to india but in the last seven years india has successfully brought back more than

27-Jan-15,"The transcript you provided is from the special episode of ""Mann Ki Baat,"" a radio program hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in which he had a conversation with President Barack Obama. They discussed various topics and answered questions from the audience. The conversation touched upon issues such as leadership, inspiring moments, and the importance of making a difference in people's lives. Both leaders shared personal experiences and insights, emphasizing the value of public service and the impact it can have on individuals and societies. The transcript also mentions the idea of creating an e-book based on their conversation and encouraging people to participate in sharing their thoughts for inclusion in the e-book.",27-jan-2015 192kb 218kb hon ble shri narendra modi today shri barack obama president of the united states joins us in a special programme of mann ki baat for the last few months i have been sharing my mann ki baat with you but today people from various parts of the country have asked questions but most of the questions are connected to politics foreign policy economic policy however some questions touch the heart and i believe if we touch those questions today we shall be able to reach out to the common man in different parts of the country and therefore the questions asked in press conferences or discussed in meetings instead of those if we discuss what comes from the heart and repeat it hum it we get a new energy and therefore in my opinion those questions are more important some people wonder what does barack mean i was searching for the meaning of barack in swahili language which is spoken in parts of africa barack means one who is blessed i believe along with a name his family gave him a big gift african countries have lived by the ancient idea of ubuntu which alludes to the oneness in humanity they say i am because we are despite the gap in centuries and borders there is the same spirit of vasudhaiva kutumbakam which speak of in india this is the great shared heritage of humanity this unites us when we discuss mahatma gandhi we remember henry thoreau from whom mahatma gandhi learnt disobedience when we talk about martin luther king or obama we hear from their lips respect for mahatma gandhi these are the things that unite the world today barack obama is with us i will first request him to share his thoughts then i and barack will both answer the questions that have been addressed to us i request president barack obama to say a few words hon ble shri barack obama namaste thank you prime minister modi for your kind words and for the incredible hospitality you have shown me and my wife michelle on this visit and let me say to the people of india how honoured i am to be the first american president to join you for republic day and i m told that this is also the first ever radio address by an indian prime minister and an american president together so we re making a lot of history in a short time now to the people of india listening all across this great nation it s wonderful to be able to speak you directly we just come from discussions in which we affirmed that india and the united states are natural partners because we have so much in common we are two great democracies two innovative economies two diverse societies dedicated to empowering individuals we are linked together by millions of proud indian americans who still have family and carry on traditions from india and i want to say to the prime minister how much i appreciate your strong personal commitment to strengthening the relationship between these two countries people are very excited in the united states about the energy that prime minister modi is bringing to efforts in this country to reduce extreme poverty and lift people up to empower women to provide access to electricity and clean energy and invest in infrastructure and the education system and on all these issues we want to be partners because many of the efforts that i am promoting inside the united states to make sure that the young people get the best education possible to make sure that the ordinary people are properly compensated for their labour and paid fair wages and have job security and health care these are the same kinds of issues that prime minister modi i know cares so deeply about here and i think there s a common theme in these issues it gives us a chance to reaffirm what gandhi ji reminded us should be a central aim of our lives and that is we should endeavour to seek god through service of humanity because god is in everyone so these shared values these convictions are a large part of why i am so committed to this relationship i believe that if the united states and india join together on the world stage around these values then not only will our peoples be better off but i think the world will be more prosperous and more peaceful and more secure for the future so thank you so much mr prime minister for giving me this opportunity to be with you here today hon ble shri narendra modi barack the first question comes from raj from mumbai his question is the whole world knows about your love for your daughters how will you tell your daughters about youre experience of india do you plan to do some shopping for them hon ble shri barack obama well first of all they very much wanted to come they are fascinated by india unfortunately each time that i have taken a trip here they had school and they couldn t leave school and in fact malia my older daughter had exams just recently they are fascinated by the culture and the history of india in part because of my influence i think they are deeply moved by india s movement to independence and the role that gandhi played in not only the non violent strategies here in india but how those ended up influencing the non violent civil rights movement in the united states so when i go back i am going to tell them that india is as magnificent as they imagined and i am quite sure that they are going to insist that i bring them back the next time i visit it may not be during my presidency but afterwards they will definitely want to come and visit and i will definitely do some shopping for them although i can t go to the stores myself so i have to have my team do the shopping for me and i ll get some advice from michelle because she probably has a better sense of what they would like hon ble shri narendra modi barack said he will come with his daughters i extend an invitation to you whether you come as president or thereafter india looks forward to welcoming you and your daughters sanika diwan from pune maharashtra has asked me a question she asks me whether i have sought assistance from president obama for the beti bachao beti padhao mission sanika you have asked a good question there is a lot of worry because of the sex ratio in india for every 1000 boys the number of girls is less and the main reason for this is that there is a defect in our attitudes towards boys and girls whether or not i seek help from president obama his life is in itself an inspiration the way he has brought up his two daughters the way he is proud of his two daughters in our country too i meet many families who have only daughters and they bring up their daughters with such pride give them such respect that is the biggest inspiration i believe that inspiration is our strength and in response to your question i would like to say to save the girl child to educate the girl child this is our social duty cultural duty and humanitarian responsibility we should honour it barack there is a question for you the second question for president obama comes through e mail dr kamlesh upadhyay a doctor based in ahmedabad gujarat your wife is doing extensive work on tackling modern health challenges like obesity and diabetes these are increasingly being faced in india as well would you and the first lady like to return to india to work on these issues after your presidency just like bill and melinda gates hon ble barack obama well we very much look forward to partnering with organizations and the government and non governmental organizations here in india around broader public health issues including the issue of obesity i am very proud of the work that michelle has done on this issue we re seeing a world wide epidemic of obesity in many cases starting at a very young age and a part of it has to do with increase in processed foods not naturally prepared part of it is a lack of activity for too many children and once they are on this path it can lead to a life time of health challenges this is an issue that we would like to work on internationally including here in india and it is a part of a broader set of issues around global health that we need to address the prime minister and i have discussed for example how we can do a better job in dealing with issues like pandemic and making sure that we have good alert systems so that if a disease like ebola or a deadly flu virus or polio appears it is detected quickly and then treated quickly so that it doesn t spread the public health infrastructure around the world needs to be improved i think the prime minister is doing a great job in focusing on these issues here in india and india has a lot to teach many other countries who may not be advancing as rapidly in improving this public health sector but it has an impact on everything because if children are sick they can t concentrate in school and they fall behind it has a huge economic impact on the countries involved and so we think that there is a lot of progress to be made here and i am very excited about the possibilities of considering this work even after i leave office hon ble shri narendra modi mr arjun asks me a question an interesting question he says he has seen an old photo of me as a tourist outside the white house he asks me what touched me when i went there last september it is true that when i first went to america i was not lucky enough to visit the white house there is an iron fence far from the white house we stood outside the fence and took a photograph white house is visible in the background now that i have become prime minister that photo too has become popular but at that time i had never thought that sometime in my life i would get a chance to visit the white house but when i visited the white house one thing touched my heart i can never forget that barack gave me a book a book that he had located after considerable effort that book had become famous in 1894 swami vivekananda the inspiration of my life had gone to chicago to participate in the world religions conference and this book was a compilation of the speeches delivered at the world religions conference that touched my heart and not just this he turned the pages of the book and showed me what was written there he had gone through the entire book and he told me with pride i come from the chicago where swami vivekananda had come these words touched my heart a lot and i will treasure this throughout my life so once standing far from the white house and taking a photo and then to visit the white house and to receive a book on someone whom i respect you can imagine how it would have touched my heart barack there is a question for you himani from ludhiana punjab question is for you hon ble shri barack obama well the question is did you both imagine you would reach the positions that you ve reached today and it is interesting mr prime minister your talking about the first time you visited white house and being outside that iron fence the same is true for me when i first went to the white house i stood outside that same fence and looked in and i certainly did not imagine that i would ever be visiting there much less living there you know i think both of us have been blessed with an extraordinary opportunity coming from relatively humble beginnings and when i think about what s best in america and what s best in india the notion that a tea seller or somebody who s born to a single mother like me could end up leading our countries is an extraordinary example of the opportunities that exist within our countries now i think a part of what motivates both you and i is the belief that there are millions of children out there who have the same potential but may not have the same education may not be getting exposed to opportunities in the same way and so a part of our job a part of government s job is that young people who have talent and who have drive and are willing to work for are able to succeed and that s why we are emphasizing school higher education making sure that children are healthy and making sure those opportunities are available to children of all backgrounds girls and boys people of all religious faiths and of all races in the united states is so important because you never know who might be the next prime minister of india or who might be the next president of united states they might not always look the part right off the bat and they might just surprise you if you give them the chance hon ble shri narendra modi thank you barack himani from ludhiana has also asked me this question did i ever imagine i would reach this high office no i never imagined it because as barack said i come from a very ordinary family but for a long time i have been telling everyone never dream of becoming something if you wish to dream dream of doing something when we do something we get satisfaction and also get inspiration to do something new if we only dream of becoming something and cannot fulfil the dream then we only get disappointed and therefore i never dreamt of becoming something even today i have no dream of becoming something but i do dream of doing something serving mother india serving 125 crore indians there can be no greater dream than this that is what i have to do i am thankful to himani there is a question for barack from omprakash omprakash is studying sanskrit at jnu he belongs to jhunjunu rajasthan om prakash is convener of special centre for sanskrit studies in jnu hon ble shri barack obama well this is a very interesting question his question is the youth of the new generation is a global citizen he is not limited by time or boundaries in such a situation what should be the approach by our leadership governments as well as societies at large i think this is a very important question when i look at this generation that is coming up they are exposed to the world in ways that you and i could hardly imagine they have the world at their fingertips literally they can using their mobile phone get information and images from all around the world and that s extraordinarily powerful and what that means i think is that governments and leaders cannot simply try to govern or rule by a top down strategy but rather have to reach out to people in an inclusive way and an open way and a transparent way and engage in a dialogue with citizens about the direction of their country and one of the great things about india and the united states is that we are both open societies and we have confidence and faith that when citizens have information and there is a vigorous debate that over time even though sometimes democracy is frustrating the best decisions and the most stable societies emerge and the most prosperous societies emerge and new ideas are constantly being exchanged and technology today i think facilitates that not just within countries but across countries and so i have much greater faith in india and the united states countries that are open information societies in being able to succeed and thrive in this new information age than closed societies that try to control the information that citizens receive because ultimately that s no longer possible information will flow inevitably one way or the other and we want to make sure we are fostering a healthy debate and a good conversation between all peoples hon ble shri narendra modi omprakash wants me too to answer the question that has been asked to barack barack has given a very good answer it is inspiring i will only say that once upon a time there were people inspired primarily by the communist ideology they gave a call workers of the world unite this slogan lasted for several decades i believe looking at the strength and reach of today s youth i would say youth unite the world i believe they have the strength and they can do it the next question is from ca pikashoo mutha from mumbai and he asks me which american leader has inspired you when i was young i used to see kennedy s pictures in indian newspapers his personality was very impressive but your question is who has inspired me i liked reading as a child and i got an opportunity to read the biography of benjamin franklin he lived in the eighteenth century and he was not an american president but his biography is so inspiring how a person can intelligently try to change his life if we feel excessively sleepy how can we reduce that if we feel like eating too much how can we work towards eating less if people get upset with you that cannot meet them because of the pressure of work then how to solve this problem he has addressed such issues in his biography and i tell everyone we should read benjamin franklin s biography even today it inspires me and benjamin franklin had a multi dimensional personality he was a politician he was a political scientist he was a social worker he was a diplomat and he came from an ordinary family he could not even complete his education but till today his thoughts have an impact on american life i find his life truly inspiring and i tell you too if you read his biography you will find ways to transform your life too and he has talked about simple things so i feel you will be inspired as much as i have been there is a question for barack from monika bhatia hon ble shri barack obama well the question is as leaders of two major economies what inspires you and makes you smile at the end of a bad day at work and that is a very good question i say sometimes that the only problems that come to my desk are the ones that nobody else solves if they were easy questions then somebody else would have solved them before they reached me so there are days when it s tough and frustrating and that s true in foreign affairs that is true in domestic affairs but i tell you what inspires me and i don t know mr prime minister if you share this view almost every day i meet somebody who tells me you made a difference in my life so they ll say the health care law that you passed saved my child who didn t have health insurance and they were able to get an examination from a physician and they caught an early tumour and now he is doing fine or they will say you helped me save my home during the economic crisis or they ll say i couldn t afford college and the program you set up has allowed me to go to the university and sometimes they are thanking you for things that you did four or five years ago sometimes they are thanking you for things you don t even remember or you re not thinking about that day but it is a reminder of what you said earlier which is if you focus on getting things done as opposed to just occupying an office or maintaining power then the satisfaction that you get is unmatched and the good thing about service is that anybody can do it if you are helping somebody else the satisfaction that you can get from that i think exceeds anything else that you can do and that s usually what makes me inspired to do more and helps get through the challenges and difficulties that we all have because obviously we are not the only people with bad days at work i think everybody knows what it is like to have a bad day at work you just have to keep on working through it eventually you make a difference hon ble shri narendra modi indeed barack has spoken words from the heart mann ki baat whatever position we may hold we are human too simple things can inspire us i also wish to narrate an experience for many years i was like an ascetic i got food at other people s homes whoever invited me used to feed me as well once a family invited me over for a meal repeatedly i would not go because i felt they are too poor and if i go to eat at their place i will become a burden on them but eventually i had to bow to their request and love and i went to eat a meal at their home it was a small hut where we sat down to eat they offered me roti made of bajra millet and mik their young child was looking at the milk i felt the child has never even seen milk so i gave that small bowl of milk to the child and he drank it within seconds his family members were angry with him and i felt that perhaps that child has never had any milk apart from his mother s milk and maybe they had bought milk so that i could have a good meal this incident inspired me a lot a poor person living in a hut could think so much about my well being so i should devote my life to their service so these are the things that serve as inspiration and barack has also spoken about what can touch the heart i am thankful to barack he has given so much time and i am thankful to my countrymen for listening to mann ki baat i know radio reaches every home and every lane of india and this mann ki baat this special mann ki baat will echo forever i have an idea i share it with you there should be an e book made of the talk between barack and me today i hope the organizers of mann ki baat will release this e book and to you all who have listened to mann ki baat i also say do participate in this and the best hundred thoughts that emerge out of this will also be added to this e book and i want you to write to us on twitter on facebook or online using the hashtag yeswecan eliminate poverty yeswecan quality healthcare to all yeswecan youth empowered with education yeswecan jobs for all yeswecan end to terrorism yeswecan global peace and progress yeswecan i want you to send your thoughts experiences and feelings after listening to mann ki baat from them we will select the best hundred and we will add them to the book containing the talk that barack and i have had and i believe this will truly become

great man my dear countrymen on the 26th of january 1950 our constitution came in to being our country was proclaimed a republic yesterday we celebrated republic day with pride and fervour but today i want to speak to you on a totally different aspect our country possesses a very important institution besides being an integral part of our democracy it is even older than our republic i am referring to our election commission the 25th of january was the formation day of the election commission which is celebrated now as the national voters day the scale at which elections are held in india is a matter of great awe for the world it is natural for every citizen to feel proud of the election commission of its meticulous organising abilities our country leaves no stone unturned to ensure that every citizen of india who is a registered voter rightfully avails of the opportunity to cast his vote whereas we hear of a polling station at 15 000 feet above mean sea level in himachal pradesh we also learn about the same being organised in remote islands of the andaman nicobar archipelago and you must have heard about gujarat in a remote place in gir forest there is a polling booth for a sole voter just imagine for that one and only voter these facts are bound to instil a sense of pride of the commitment of the election commission caring for that lone voter for ensuring that he or she enjoys full opportunity to exercise the right to vote personnel of election commission travel to distant remote places to make necessary arrangements for the voting this is the beauty of our democracy i appreciate the election commission for relentlessly striving to ensure the strengthening of our democracy i hold in high esteem the election commissions of all states security personnel and other staff members who contribute in ensuring strict adherence to free and fair polling this year our country will undergo lok sabha elections the first time ever young persons born in the 21st century will exercise their right to vote in the lok sabha elections they face the opportunity to shoulder responsibilities pertaining to the country they have embarked upon the journey of being partners in nation building the time has come for a confluence of individual dreams and the nation s dream i urge the young generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible all of us must realise that being a voter earning the right to vote is an important rite of passage in one s life it s one of its achievements simultaneously the sentiment that voting is our sacred duty should grow within us naturally for any reason if one is not able to vote it should pain one one should be saddened to witness any wrong taking place in the country i had not cast my vote that day i did not go and vote and as a result my country has borne the brunt we have to realise the importance of this responsibility of ours this must be our leaning this should be our disposition this inclination should be ingrained within us like a sanskaar i urge eminent people of the country to come forward and jointly contribute in campaigning for spreading awareness on voter registration and casting one s vote on the day of polling i sincerely hope that large numbers of eligible young people will get themselves registered as voters thus forging a partnership in the quest to further strengthen our democracy my dear countrymen this great land india has given birth to innumerable great men men whose deeds for the sake for humanity have been extraordinary truly unforgettable our country is bahuratna vasundhara the land of myriad gems one among them was netaji subash chandra bose on the 23rd of january the country celebrated the birth anniversary of netaji in an uncommon special manner on this occasion i was fortunate to get an opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to heroes who fought in india s freedom struggle you may be aware of the fact that inside red fort many chambers and structures lay locked unused for several decades after independence those very chambers have now been turned into exquisite museums a museum dedicated to netaji subhash chandra bose and the indian national army yaad e jalian reminiscences of jalianwala bagh and 1857 india s first war of independence constitute the premises of kranti mandir that has been dedicated to the nation every inch every brick of these museums is redolent with the fragrance of our glorious history tales of valour of the heroes of our freedom struggle emanating from every nook corner of these museums inspire us to delve deeper into our history this was the very site where three heroic sons of mother india col prem sehgal col gurbaksh singh dhillon and major general shahnawaz khan had to face a trial under british rule on my visit to kranti mandir red fort as i was reflecting on memories of netaji his family members gifted me a special cap there was a time when netaji used to wear it i dedicated that cap to the museum itself for visitors to see and be inspired with the spirit of patriotism the fact is stories of the valour and patriotism of our heroes should be told and re told to our newer generations in ways more than one just a month ago on the 30th of december i had gone to andaman nicobar islands at an event our tricolour was unfurled at the very site where netaji subhash bose had unfurled it exactly 75 years ago in a similar manner when the tricolour was hoisted at the red fort in october 2018 it surprised everyone since conventionally this is done on the 15th of august the occasion was the completion of 75 years of the formation of the azad hind government subhash babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and adept organiser a valiant fighter who played a significant role in our freedom struggle through his clarion calls dilli chalo tum mujhe khoon do main tumhe azadi doonga netaji secured a special place in every indian s heart that files associated with netaji be declassified has been a long standing demand for years and i am happy that we could manage to do the same i remember the day when netaji s family paid a visit to the prime minister s residence we dwelt at length on myriad facets of netaji subhash bose offering him tributes it gladdens me to see many places associated with illustrious sons of india being developed in delhi be it 26 alipur road associated with babasaheb ambedkar or the sardar patel museum or the kranti mandir whenever you come to delhi you must pay a visit to these places my dear countrymen today as we refer to netaji subhash chandra bose that too in mann ki baat i would like to share with you an incident from netaji s life i have always considered radio as an effective means of connecting with people similarly netaji shared a deep bond with the medium of radio and he chose this very medium to converse with countrymen in 1942 subhash babu established azad hind radio and through it he used to communicate with soldiers of the indian national army and other countrymen subhash babu had a distinct style of opening a broadcast in the opening he would begin with this is subhash chandra bose speaking to you over the azad hind radio these words instantly stirred up listeners with a rush of a new energy a new fervour i am told this radio station also used to broadcast weekly news bulletins in english hindi tamil bangla marathi punjabi pashto urdu languages in managing the affairs of this radio station a resident of gujarat m r vyas ji played a vital role programmes broadcast over azad hind radio were very popular amongst the populace their programmes were a major source of inspiration strength to our freedom fighters in this very kranti mandir a visual arts museum has been established india s art culture has been portrayed here in a very attractive way the museum has 4 historical exhibitions which display more than 450 paintings and artworks which are of three centuries vintage exquisite works of great artists such as amrita shergill raja ravi verma avanindranath tagore gaganendranath tagore nandalal bose jamini roy sailoz mukherjee have been exhibited and i also specially request you to visit the place and see for yourself the works of gurudev rabindranath tagore ji now you must be thinking that we are discussing art and here i m talking about seeing gurudev tagore s excellent works of art you have probably known gurudev rabindranath tagore till date as a writer and a musician but i would like to tell you that gurudev was also a painter he had painted upon many themes he did paintings of many animals and birds he also painted many landscapes and not only that he also tried to depict many human characters by etching them on canvas and the most unique aspect was that gurudev tagore did not ascribe any name to most of his works he believed that the person seeing his painting should comprehend the painting in totality from his own perspective understand the message imparted by him in the particularpainting his paintings have been on display in european countries in russia and in america i hope you will go and see his paintings in the kranti mandir my dear countrymen india is a land of saints our saints have conveyed the message of goodwill equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and deeds one such saint was sant ravidas on 19th february we will observe ravidas jayanti the couplets or dohas of sant ravidas ji are very well known sant ravidas used to convey a profound message through the few lines of his couplet or doha he had said which would translate something like this that if you were to peel the stem of the banana tree there appear leaves underneath which form the psuedostem one can go peeling the leaves forming the stem till there isn t any tree left at all similarly man has been divided into castes and the human in him has disappeared sant ravidas proposed that if god was present in every human being then it was not fair to categorize him on the basis of caste creed and other sociological demarcations guru ravidas ji was born in the holy city of varanasi sant ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and the worker throughout his life via his messages it would not be wrong to say that he has illustrated to the entire world the real meaning of dignity of labour he would say that is if your heart is pure then the absolute master resides within your heart sant ravidas ji has influenced people cutting across every segment and class of the social milieu whether it was the maharana of chittor or his queen or meerabai everyone was his follower were followers i once again bow in reverence to sant ravidas ji my dear countrymen kiran sidar has written on mygov that i should highlight the aspects of india s space program and its future he also wants me to request the students to take interest in the space programs and to think out of the box and inspire them to go beyond the frontiers of the sky kiran ji i appreciate your thoughts and especially the message being imparted to our children a few days ago i was in ahmedabad where i got the privilege of unveiling the statue of dr vikram sarabhai dr vikram sarabhai has had an important role in india s space program our space program has been possible due to innumerable young scientists of the country we take pride in the fact that the satellites developed by our students and sounding rockets have reached space on 24th january kalam sat fashioned by our students had been launched the sounding rockets made by odisha university

reach across those boundaries which were considered impossible till today it is a vision to inspire the children to discover new stars while gazing at them my dear countrymen i always say those who

parking shed with their family the captain of maharashtra under 21 women s kabaddi team sonali helvi is from satara she lost her father at a very young age and her brother and mother encouraged the

olympics in tokyo you have to boost the morale of our athletes have to motivate them with your message he was so committed and emotional for sports that he immediately gave his consent even during his illness but unfortunately providence had other plans i still remember he had come to surat in 2014 we had inaugurated a night marathon the interaction that i had with him then the chat about sports that happened that inspired me a lot too we all know that the entire family of milkha singh has been dedicated to sports has been adding to the glory of india friends when talent dedication determination and sportsman spirit come together only then a champion is made in our country most of the sportspersons hail from the smaller towns and villages our team that is going to tokyo too has many such players whose life inspires a lot when you hear about our praveen jadhav ji then you too will feel how many difficulties praveen has gone through to reach here praveen hails from a village in satara district of maharashtra he is very good at archery his parents run the family by working as labourers and now their son is going to participate in his first olympics at tokyo this is a

height we attain this connection with the ground always keeps us bound to our roots the joy of success experienced after a period of struggle is something else our players going to tokyo faced scarcity of means and resources in their childhood but they persevered and endured with fortitude the life of priyanka goswami ji of muzaffarnagar uttar pradesh also teaches a lot priyanka s father is

first indian fencer to qualify in the olympics i was reading somewhere that in order for bhavani ji s training to continue her mother had even mortgaged her jewellery friends there are numerous such names but in mann ki baat today i have been able to mention only a few every player going to tokyo has had one s own share of struggle and years of toil they are going not only for themselves but for the country these players also have to enhance the glory of india and win the hearts of the people and that is why my countrymen i want to advise you too that we should not pressurize these players

extraordinary milestone just a few days ago our country accomplished an unprecedented feat on the 21st of june the next phase of the vaccination campaign commenced and that very day the country registered a record of administering vaccines to over 86 lakh people free of cost that too on a single day such a huge number of free vaccinations by the government of india that too in a day it is but natural that it was widely discussed friends a year ago the question that was confronting all was when will the vaccine come today in a day we are administering the made in india vaccine to lakhs of people free of cost and this indeed is the strength of new india friends we have to keep making efforts to ensure that every citizen is able to avail of safety through the vaccine at many places in order to end vaccine hesitancy myriad organizations and members of civil society have come forward and together they are doing a wonderful job come let us too visit a village and speak to people about the vaccine let s go to village dulariya district betul madhya pradesh pm hello rajesh namaskar pm namaste ji rajesh my name is rajesh hiraawe gram panchayat dulariya bhimpur block pm rajesh ji i called up since i wanted to know about the corona situation in your village as of now rajesh sir the corona situation here well there s nothing of that sort here pm people are not ailing now rajesh ji pm what is the population of the village how many people are there rajesh sir there are 462 men and 332 women in the village pm fine rajesh ji have you taken the vaccine rajesh no sir not yet pm o why not rajesh sir some people here created such a delusion on whatsapp that many were misled sir pm so even you bear a fear in your mind rajesh yes sir the entire village was being misled pm oh what have you said see rajesh ji rajesh ji pm i would like to urge you and all my brothers and sisters in the village to dispel fear if any rajesh ji pm in our country over 31 crore people have got themselves vaccinated rajesh ji pm you know very well i ve myself been vaccinated with both doses rajesh ji sir pm and my mother is close to a hundred years of age she too has taken both doses at times some people develop fever on account of this but it s very minor just for a few hours see not getting vaccinated can prove dangerous rajesh ji pm that way you expose yourself to risk not just that you can endanger the family as well as the village rajesh ji pm and rajesh ji that is why as soon as possible get yourself vaccinated and in the village tell everyone that the vaccine is being administered by the government of india free of cost and for all persons above 18 years of age this vaccination is free rajesh ji ji pm so do tell this to people in the village and this is not at all a reason for an atmosphere of fear in the village rajesh sir the reason is some of them have spread such a misleading rumour that deeply scared people for example developing fever after taking the vaccine the fever leading to other ailments rumour has been spread to the extent that it leads to a person s death pm alas these days there is so much of radio and television so much of news hence it becomes easy for making people understand and let me tell you there are many villages in india where people have availed of the vaccine i mean cent percent of them i ll give you one such example rajesh ji pm there s district bandipora in kashmir in this district people of village weyan together set themselves a target of 100 vaccines and also achieved it today in this village in kashmir all persons above the age of 18 have taken the vaccine i came to know about three villages in nagaland also where people have been vaccinated a 100 percent rajesh ji ji pm rajesh ji you too should communicate this across your village and neighbouring villages and the way you also put it it is a fallacy just something misleading rajesh ji ji pm so the only way to address this fallacy is convincing others by getting yourself vaccinated you will do that won t you rajesh ji sir pm will you do it for sure rajesh ji sir ji sir talking to you made me feel that i should get myself vaccinated and mobilise others to get the same done pm okay is there anyone else in the village i could talk to rajesh yes sir there is pm who will speak kishorilal hello sir namaskar pm namaste ji who is speaking kishorilal sir my name is kishorilaldurve pm so kishorilal ji we were just speaking to rajesh ji kishorilal ji sir pm and he was lamenting that people indulge in a lot of loose talk around the vaccine kishorilal ji pm have you too heard something like that kishorilal yes i have heard such things sir pm what have you heard kishorilal since sir maharashtra is close by some relatives staying there spread rumours that people are dying because of the vaccine some are getting sick people are full of misconceptions that is why they are not taking it sir pm no what do they say now corona is over is that what they say kishorilal ji pm do they say that nothing happens due to corona kishorilal no sir they don t say that corona is gone they say corona is there but that people who take vaccines are getting sick all are dying that is the situation they describe pm okay meaning people are dying because of the vaccine kishorilal ours is a tribal area sir as it is people get scared quickly which leads to spreading of mistaken notions that s why people are not taking the vaccine sir pm see kishorilal ji kishorilal yes sir pm those spreading rumours will keep on doing so kishorilal ji ji pm we have to save lives we have to save our village and our countrymen if someone says corona is gone do not be under this mistaken notion kishorilal ji pm this ailment is like a master of disguise kishorilal ji sir pm it keeps changing its looks surfaces in myriad new forms and colours kishorilal ji pm and to protect ourselves from it we have two ways one is adhering to the protocol for corona wearing a mask frequently washing hands with soap maintaining distancing and the other way is along with all this getting vaccinated that too is a good safety shield think about that kishorilal ji prime minister ok kishorilal ji tell us one thing kishorilal ji sir prime minister when people talk to you how do you communicate it to them you try to convince people or do you get carried away by rumours kishorilal what to convince when there are people in large numbers we too are overtaken by fear sir prime minister look kishorilal ji i have spoken to you today you are my friend kishorilal ji sir prime minister you don t have to be afraid and have to remove fear from people too will you kishorilal ji sir will dispel that sir will remove fear from people too sir i myself will get it done prime minister look don t at all pay attention to rumours kishorilal ji prime minister you know how much hard work our scientists have put in to make this vaccine kishorilal ji ji sir prime minister through the year many senior scientists have worked and that is why we have to believe in science believe in scientists and should explain to these propagators of falsehood that look brothers it is not so so many people have

spoke to us many many thanks to you too friends someday this will be a subject of case study for the world that how during this corona period people of villages of india our forest dwellers tribal brothers sisters displayed their capabilities and understanding people of villages set up quarantine centres made covid protocol as per local requirements people of villages did not let anybody sleep hungry did not let work in fields stop either the villages also ensured daily supply of milk and vegetables to nearby cities that is they took care of themselves and of others too we have to keep doing the same way in the vaccination campaign too we have to be aware and make others aware too every person in the village gets vaccinated this should be the goal for all villages remember and i specially want to tell you ask a question to yourself everyone wants to be successful but what is the deciding mantra for success the decisive mantra for success is continuity so we don t have to get lax don t have to get in delusion we have to keep making efforts continuously register victory over corona my dear countrymen now the monsoon season has also arrived in our country when the clouds rain they rain not only for us but also for the generations to come rain water also collects in the ground it also replenishes the water level of the ground and that s why i consider water conservation as a form of service to the country you too must have seen many of us are taking this pious work as their responsibility one such person is satchidanand bharti ji of pauri garhwal uttarakhand bharti ji is a teacher and he has imparted very good education to the people through his deeds today due to his hard work the huge water crisis in the ufrainkhal area of pauri garhwal has come to an end where people used to pine for water today there is continuous supply of water throughout the year friends in the hills there exists a traditional method of water conservation which is called chalkhal that is it involves digging a big pit to collect water bharti ji also added some new methods to this tradition he regularly got small and big ponds dug due to this not only the hills of ufrainkhal turned green but the problem of drinking water of the people was also solved you will be surprised to know that bharti ji has got more than 30 thousand such water tanks constructed 30 thousand this monumental work of his continues even today and is inspiring many people friends similarly the people of andhav village in banda district of up have also made an innovative effort and have given a very interesting name to their campaign khet ka pani khet mein gaon ka panigaonmein under this campaign high bunds have been raised in several hundred bighas of fields of the village as a result rain water started collecting in the field and started percolating into the ground now these people are also planning to plant trees on the bunds of the fields that is now farmers will get all three water trees and money as it is the village is getting recognized far and wide due to its good work friends taking inspiration from all of these efforts we can also conserve water around us in whatever way possible we should save it we must not to miss this crucial period of the monsoon season my dear countrymen it is said in our scriptures nasti moolam anoushadham that is there is no such plant on earth which does not have any medicinal properties there are many such trees and plants around us which have amazing properties but many times we do not even know about them bhai paritosh a friend from nainital has also sent me a letter on the same subject he has written that he came to know about miraculous medicinal properties of giloy and many other plants only after the outbreak of corona paritosh has also urged me to tell all the listeners of mann ki baat that we should know about the flora around us and also convey to others in fact this is our centuries old heritage which we have to preserve in this direction mr ramlotan kushwaha ji a friend from satna of madhya pradesh has done a very commendable job ramlotan ji has built a museum of indigenous plantson his farm in this museum he has collected hundreds of medicinal plants and seeds and he has brought them here from far flung regions apart from this he also grows many types of indian vegetables every year people visit this garden this museum of ramlotan ji and learn a lot from it indeed this is a very good experiment which can be replicated in different regions of the country i would like that those of you who can make such an effort should attempt it this can also open up new sources of income for you another benefit will be that the identity of your area will gain wide prominence through the local medicinal plants my dear countrymen a few days from now we will celebrate national doctors day on the 1st of july this day is dedicated to the birth anniversary of the great doctor and statesman of the country dr b c roy we are all grateful for the contribution of doctors in the corona period our doctors have served us without caring about their lives therefore this time around national doctors day becomes all the more special friends hippocrates one of the most respected persons in the world of medicine had said wherever the art of medicine is loved there is also a love of humanity doctors are able to serve us with the power of this very love therefore it is our duty to thank them with an equal measure of affection and encourage them by the way there are many people in our country who have come forward and worked to help the doctors i came to know about one such attempt from srinagar here a boat ambulance service was started at dal lake this service was started by tariq ahmad patloo ji of srinagar who is a houseboat owner he himself has also fought the battle with covid 19 and this inspired him to start the ambulance service a campaign is also underway to make people aware of this ambulance and continuous announcements from the ambulance are being made by him the effort is that people should wear a mask and undertake other necessary precautions too friends along with doctors day chartered accountants day is also celebrated on the 1st of july a few years ago i had asked for global level indian audit firms as a gift from chartered accountants of the country today i want to remind them of that chartered accountants can play a very worthy and positive role in bringing transparency to the economy i extend my best wishes to all chartered accountants and their family members my dear countrymen there is one great feature of india s fight against corona each and every person of the country has played their part in this fight i have often spoken about this in mann ki baat but some people also complain that not a lot is discussed about them many people whether they are bank staff teachers small traders or shopkeepers people working in shops street vendors security watchmen postmen and post office employees actually this list is very long and everyone has played his or her part innumerable people have been involved with government and administration at different levels friends you have probably heard the name of guru prasad mohapatra ji who was the secretary to the government of india today in mann ki baat i want to speak about him too guruprasad ji was diagnosed with corona he was admitted in the hospital and yet at the same time was performing his official duties too he toiled day and night to increase the oxygen producing capacities of the country and to ensure that oxygen reached far flung areas on the one hand the affairs of the court the pressure of the media he kept fighting on many fronts simultaneously and did not stop working during his illness even after being told not to he used to insist on joining the video conferences on oxygen such was his concern for his countrymen he kept on making arrangements to deliver oxygen to the people of the country regardless of himself being on the hospital bed it is sad for all of us that the country has also lost this karmayogi corona has snatched him away from us there are countless people who have never been discussed our tribute to every such person would be that we follow the covid protocol fully get our vaccinations done my dear countrymen the best thing about mann ki baat is that you all contribute to it more than me i saw a post on mygov by thiru r guruprasad ji from chennai you too will be pleased to know what he has written he has written that he is a regular listener of the program mann ki baat i am quoting a few lines from guruprasad ji s post he has written whenever you talk about tamil nadu my interest increases even more you have discussed the greatness of tamil language and tamil culture tamil festivals and major places in tamil nadu guru prasad ji further writes in mann ki baat you have also spoken many times about the achievements of the people of tamil nadu what to say about your love for thirukkural and your respect for thiruvalluvar ji that s why i have prepared an e book by compiling all that you have spoken about tamil nadu in mann ki baat will you say something about this e book and also release it on the namo app thanks i was reading the letter of guruprasad ji for you guruprasad ji i am very happy to read this post of yours now add another page to your e book there could definitely be fault in pronunciation but my efforts and my love will never diminish i want to tell those who are not tamil speaking what i have told guruprasad ji i am a big admirer of tamil culture i am a big admirer of tamil the oldest language in the world friends every indian should cherish and feel proud that the most ancient language of the world belongs to our country i take a lot of pride in tamil guru prasad ji this effort of yours is going to give a new vision to me when i do mann ki baat i put forth my point in a simple manner i didn t know that this was even a part an element of it when you collected all our old conversations i read it not once but twice guruprasad ji i will definitely get this book of yours uploaded on the namo app best wishes to you for future endeavours my dear countrymen today we talked about the difficulties and precautions pertaining to corona and also discussed many achievements of the country and countrymen now another big opportunity is in front of us too 15th august is also approaching amrit mahotsav of 75 years of independence is a big inspiration for us let us learn to live for the country the struggle for independence is the story of those who died for the country we have to make this post independence time the story of those who live for the country our mantra should be india first every decision of ours every decision should have the basis india first friends the country has also set many collective goals in the amrit mahotsav like we have to revive the history related to our freedom fighters by remembering them you will remember that in mann ki baat i appealed to the youth to research and write history of the freedom struggle the motive was that young talents should come forward young thinking young thoughts should gain prominence the young pen should write with new energy i feel very happy to see that in a very short time more than two and a half thousand youth have come forward to do this work friends the interesting thing is that the struggle of the 19th 20th century is usually talked about but it is a matter of joy that the youth who have been born and brought up in the 21st century have taken up cudgels to bring to the forefront the history of the freedom struggle of 19th and 20th century all these people have sent the full details on mygov these people will be writing on the freedom struggle in different languages of the country such as hindi english tamil kannada bengali telugu marathi malayalam gujarati some are associated with the freedom struggle gathering information about the places around them while someone else is writing a book on tribal freedom fighters this is a good start i request all of you to join the amrit mahotsav in whichever way you can it is our good fortune that we are witness to the festival of 75 years of our independence hence the next time we meet in mann ki baat we will talk more about preparations for the amrit mahotsav may all of you stay healthy move forward following the rules related to corona and keep giving momentum to the country with your new efforts with best wishes thank you very much

me begin by wishing namaskar to all of you today the world over christians are observing easter i extend my warmest greetings to everybody on the occasion of easter some of my young friends must be busy with their examinations some of them must have gotten over with their examinations by now for those of you who still have examinations it must be a testing time with exams on one hand and t 20 cricket world cup on the other i am sure you are eagerly waiting for the match between india and australia this evening some days ago india won two fine matches against pakistan and bangladesh we are seeing a fine momentum building up in this t 20 cricket world cup today as india and australia get ready to play i convey my best wishes to both the teams with the young comprising 65 of our population there should be no reason why we should be absent from the world of sports this won t do we need to usher revolutionary changes in sports we can see that happening in india as with cricket there s now increasing interest in football hockey tennis and kabaddi you must have come to know that india will be hosting the fifa under 17 world cup next year twenty four teams from all over the world are coming to play in our country the indian football team won the gold medal at the asian games in 1951 and 1962 and came fourth in the 1956 olympics unfortunately over the decades we have slipped from there to the lowest rungs today our ranking in fifa is so low that i feel reluctant even to mention it on the other hand i have been noticing that interest in football among the youth in india has been rising be it the english premier league spanish league or the indian super league matches young indians take time out to get the latest information on these matches and watch them on television what i mean to say is given this rising popular interest in football and the opportunity of hosting fifa under 17 world cup shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports we should create an atmosphere of football football football all around for this whole year in schools colleges indeed all over india our youth the children in our schools should be drenched in sweat just playing football if that happens we shall have real fun playing the host so all of us should make the effort to ensure football reaches every village street and alley between now and the fifa under 17 world cup in 2017 we should infuse a spirit of enthusiasm in the youth one advantage of playing the host for this event is that a whole lot of infrastructure will get created with addition of sports facilities but i personally shall be happy when we are able to link every youth of our country to this game friends i would like to hear your views on how best to use the 2017 fifa under 17 world cup to our advantage how should this event be what kind of programmes should we organise the whole year to help the event gain momentum how should it be publicised what improvements do we need to make how can we increase the interest of our youth in sports through the 2017 fifa under 17 world cup how can we introduce an element of competitiveness in governments educational institutes and social organisations to associate with the game we can see all this happening in relation to cricket we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well the fifa event offers us a unique opportunity to do so can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity i view the fifa event as a great opportunity to establish india as a brand at a global level i consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of india s youth power not in the sense of winning or losing a match in the run up to and preparation for the 2017 fifa event we can harness and display our many strengths while doing so we can do image branding for india as well i look forward to your suggestions on the 2017 fifa under 17 world cup which you can send me through narendramodiapp do let me know what should be the logo and the slogans how should we propagate this throughout india what should the songs be like what should be in the souvenirs think about it friends i would like every youth of mine to become an ambassador for the 2017 fifa under 17 world cup you should robustly participate in this event it s a golden chance to build india s image my dear students you must have thought of travelling to places during your holidays there are very few people who go abroad most people visit places within their own states for a week or so some people also go outside their states last time too i had requested all of you to upload photographs of the places you visit and i have noticed that the kind of work which our department of tourism our department of culture state governments and the government of india can t do that kind of work has been accomplished by millions and millions of indian tourists photos of such magnificent places were uploaded that it was truly a delight to view them we have to take this task forward do it this time as well but this time along with a photo please write and send a small piece about the place thus displaying your creative prowess one gets to learn a lot by visiting new places things we can t learn in a classroom within our family from our friends sometimes we can learn those things by travelling we get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit we learn about people their languages foods and lifestyles someone has rightly said that a traveller without observation is a bird without wings if you have a desire to truly view you should also develop an insight india is full of diversities once you set out to see the country for the rest of your life you will keep seeing new things and still never get enough of it i have been fortunate that i had a lot of opportunities to travel when i was neither chief minister nor prime minster and i was young like you i travelled a lot perhaps there isn t a district in india which i have not visited travel plays a very strong role in shaping our lives these days the youth of india are being driven by a spirit of adventure and curiosity unlike before they don t want to go to the same old places or tread the oft beaten track they want to do something new see something new i see this as a good sign our youth should be bold they should be brave they should have the courage to set foot on places where no one has been before in this context i would like to specially congratulate coal india western coalfields limited at savaner near nagpur where there are coal mines has developed an eco friendly mine tourism circuit generally we don t think of coal mines as places to be visited when we see pictures of miners we wonder what it must be like out there we even have a saying coal blackens your hands hence people tend to stay away from coal mines but western coalfields limited has made these same coal mines a destination for tourism this is only the beginning but already nearly 10 000 people have visited this eco friendly mine tourism site at savaner near nagpur this in itself gives us an opportunity to see something new i hope that when you set out on a journey during the coming holidays you can contribute something to cleanliness too there is greater awareness about cleanliness and people are making an effort to keep tourism destinations litter free both tourists and local residents of these places are contributing to it maybe it is not being done in a very scientific way but it is being done can you too being a tourist lay stress on cleanliness at tourist destinations i am confident that our youth will definitely help me in this task tourism is a sector that provides maximum employment even the poorest person gets a chance to earn from tourism when tourists visit a place even the not so well off among them spend money rich tourists are bound to spend more money there are many employment opportunities created by tourism india lags far behind in tourism when compared to the world but if we 125 crore indians decide that we have to give importance to our tourism sector we can attract the world we can draw a very large number of tourists to our side through this we can provide new employment opportunities to several million young people in india be it the government institutions society citizens we all have to come together to make this happen come let s make an endeavour in this direction my dear young friends i don t like it when holidays are just frittered away you too should think along these lines will you let your holidays during the most important years of your life slip away just like that i will give you something to ponder upon can you resolve to add one skill one special attribute to your personality during your holidays if you don t know how to swim can you resolve to learn swimming during the holidays if you don t know how to cycle can you resolve to learn cycling during the holidays or you could tell yourself i type with just two fingers on the keyboard so shouldn t i learn proper way of typing there are so many skills to develop our personality why not learn them why not overcome some of our shortcomings why not add to our strengths do give it a thought it is not like you need lots of classes a great trainer hefty fees or a big budget for this you can find something around you let s say you decide to make the best out of waste just look for some waste material and start creating something from it you will enjoy it by the time evening falls you will marvel at what you have created from that rubbish suppose you are fond of painting and you don t know how to paint just start painting and gradually you will get better at it you must spend your holidays on building your personality by developing some new talent acquiring some new skill there can be countless areas where you could do so it is not as if these are confined to only the ones that i am spelling out for you this will help you in carving out your own identity and raising your self confidence tremendously just try it for yourself when you return to school or college and tell your classmates about what you learned during the holidays and when your friends find that they have not learned anything new they will realise that they wasted their time they will admire you you are a very determined man my friend you have accomplished something concrete this will perhaps become a big thing among friends i am confident that you will surely do it and yes do share with me what you have learned this time a lot of suggestions have come for mann ki baat on sound byte my name is abhi chaturvedi namaste dear prime minister you had said during the last summer holidays that even birds feel the summer heat so we should fill a bowl with water and place it in the balcony or the terrace so that the birds can come to have water i did this and enjoyed it and in this way i made friends with a lot of birds i request you to repeat this task in mann ki baat thank you my dear fellow citizens i would like to express my gratitude to this little boy abhi he called me up and reminded me of what i had said frankly i had forgotten about it and i did not have it in my mind that i would say something on this topic but abhi has reminded me that last year i had asked you to put an earthen bowl filled with water for the birds friends i want to thank this boy abhi chaturvedi he has reminded me of a good deed by calling me last summer i had remembered it and asked you to put water in earthen bowls for the birds during summers abhi has told me that he has been doing this for a whole year and many birds have now become his friends the great hindi poetess mahadevi verma used to love birds she wrote this in one of her poems we shall not let you fly far way we shall fill the courtyard with grains and fill the tank with sweet and cool water come let us also do what mahadevi ji used to do i greet abhi and thank him for reminding me of this very important thing shilpa kukke from mysore has raised a very humane issue she says milkmen newspaper vendors postmen come close to our homes sometimes utensil hawkers and cloth sellers too pass by our homes have we ever offered them some drinking water during the summer days have we ever given them water to drink shilpa i am very grateful to you that you have articulated something so sensitive in so simple a manner it is a small gesture but when the postman comes and we offer him water he will feel good of course it is a part of our nature in india but i am glad shilpa that you have observed these things my dear farmer brothers and sisters you must have repeatedly heard the term digital india some people feel that digital india is to do with the world of the youth in our cities no it s not like that you will be happy to learn that a kisan suvidha app has been launched to serve your interests if you download this kisan suvidha app on your mobile phone you will receive a lot of information related to agriculture and weather at your fingertips there are many topics on this app such as what is the state of the market what is the position of the wholesale market which crops are doing well these days which are the appropriate pesticides not just this there is a button on the app which will connect you directly with agricultural scientists and link you with the experts if you pose a question to them they will reply to it they will explain things to you i hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the kisan suvidha app on their mobile phones why don t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you if you feel it lacks in anything then you can complain to me also my dear farmer brothers and sisters summer is holiday time for the rest of the people but for you it is the time to sweat it out even more a farmer waits for the rains before that he puts in his life and soul to get his field ready so that not even a single drop of rain water goes waste for farmers the season just before onset of farming is of utmost importance we will have to give a thought to what will happen if there s no water can we utilise this time to visit ponds check the routes through which water flows into these ponds and spot the places where garbage or something else blocks the water from flowing because of which reservoirs get depleted can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected if we manage to save and collect more water during the first rainfall and fill up our ponds rivers and streams then even if the rains fail later our losses will be reduced but this can be possible only when we conserve each and every drop of water you must have noticed that this time it has been decided to construct five lakh ponds and farm water reservoirs under mnrega also a stress has been given to create assets for water conservation every village should save water how can we save every drop of water during the coming rains how do we begin an exercise to ensure that every drop of water in the village stays within the village you should devise a plan and get connected with government schemes so that we can start a people s movement which will help us understand the importance of water then everyone can join in the campaign for water conservation there must be many such villages in the country many progressive farmers and many conscientious citizens who have already done this kind of work but we still need to do much more in this direction my dear farmer brothers and sisters a few days ago the government of india had organised a very big kisan mela farmers fair there i saw the modern technology that is now available for farmers and how much change has come in agriculture but we have to ensure that this technology reaches the fields now even the farmers have started saying the use of fertilisers should be curtailed i welcome this excessive use of fertilisers has made our mother earth unwell we are the children of our soil so how can we watch our mother earth suffering when we add spices and condiments while cooking our food it adds to the taste but if we add too much of even the best of the spices and condiments then would one want to eat that food the same food would taste so bad isn t it the same thing happens with fertilisers as well no matter how good fertilisers may be if we use them beyond a limit they will become the cause of ruination there should be a balance in everything this will reduce your expenses and you will end up saving money our stand is clear less cost more output invest less and reap more we should move forward with this mantra and improve our agriculture sector by using scientific methods i hope we will do with full concentration whatever is necessary for water conservation we have a couple of months till the onset of monsoon do remember the more we save water the more the farmers will benefit and more lives will be saved my dear fellow citizens the world health day is on 7th april this year the theme of the world health day is beat diabetes i call upon all of you to defeat diabetes which plays host to so many diseases once it enters yours body a whole lot of undesirable guests in the form of illnesses follow it it is said that in 2014 india had about six and a half crore diabetics diabetes was found to be the cause of death in three per cent of all deaths diabetes is of two types type 1 and type 2 type 1 is hereditary if the parents have it so shall their child type 2 is due to your habits age and obesity the world is worried about diabetes and so it has been chosen as the theme for world health day on 7th april we all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause for diabetes physical labour is

world health day and its theme do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life if you are interested in yoga then do yoga or else the least you can do is to go for a walk or a run if every citizen of my country is healthy then my country will be healthy sometimes we are reluctant to get our medical check up done when the condition worsens then only does it come to our notice that it is diabetes to blame what do you lose in getting a check up done please get this much done at least everything is available and a check up can be done easily please do be concerned about this on march 24th the world observed tuberculosis day when i was a child we would be scared by the very mention of the word tb it would seem death was inevitable for anybody suffering from this dreaded disease but now we are not scared of it because everybody knows tb is curable and can be easily cured paradoxically when tb was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it but now that it is curable we have become almost careless about it compared to the world we still have a large number of tb patients if we want to free ourselves and our country from tb then we need correct treatment we need complete treatment if we leave the treatment mid way it can create new complications for us tuberculosis is one disease that even the neighbours can spot oh look you have a persistent cough and fever and you have lost weight go get it checked you must have got tb this shows tb is one illness that can be detected fast my dear fellow citizens there is a lot of work being done in this direction there are more than 13 500 microscopy centres more than four lakh dots providers various advanced laboratories and all these services are free please go and get a check up done this disease can be got rid of all one needs is the correct treatment and the treatment must continue till the illness is gone completely i would like to appeal to you all whether it is tb or diabetes we have to conquer these we have to eradicate these diseases from india but this cannot happen with just the efforts of the government or by doctors or medicines till you don t do something about it so i call upon all of you today to defeat diabetes and free ourselves from tuberculosis my dear fellow citizens a number of important occasions are coming up in april especially on 14th of april which happens to be the birth

27-Mar-22,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on March 27, 2022, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated India's achievement of reaching a $400 billion export target, highlighting the growth of India's supply chain and its global demand. He emphasized the importance of local products becoming global and lauded the role of small entrepreneurs and the MSME sector in achieving this milestone. The Prime Minister also acknowledged the success of Ayush startups and their contribution to the healthcare sector, urging them to create content in various languages to reach a wider audience. He praised individuals like Chandrakishore Patil and Rahul Maharana for their efforts in promoting cleanliness and water conservation. Modi shared stories of remarkable initiatives like the ""Pots for Water of Life"" project in Kerala and encouraged people to save water, emphasizing the role of children as ""Water Warriors."" He also mentioned the Madhavpur Mela, an event that symbolizes the unity of India's diverse cultures. Lastly, he urged citizens to visit places associated with social reformers like Mahatma Phule, Savitribai Phule, and Babasaheb Ambedkar and shared his upcoming plans to visit Panch Teerth sites. The Prime Minister extended his best wishes for the upcoming festivals and reiterated the significance of celebrating together to strengthen India's diversity.",27-mar-2022 my dear countrymen namaskar last week we achieved a feat that filled all of us with pride you must have heard that last week india has achieved the export target of 400 billion i e 30 lakh crore rupees at first instance it might come across as a matter related to the economy but more than the economy it is related to the capability of india the potential of india at one time the figure of exports from india used to be 100 billion at times 150 billion sometimes 200 billion today india has reached 400 billion dollars in a way this means that the demand for items made in india is increasing all over the world the other meaning is that the supply chain of india is getting stronger by the day and it also has a very big message the nation takes great strides when resolves are bigger than dreams when there is a sincere effort day and night for the resolves those resolutions also attain fruition and you see the same happens in a person s life as well when one s resolve one s efforts become bigger than one s dreams success comes to the person on its own friends new ever new products from all corners of the country are reaching foreign shores leather products from hailakandi in assam or handloom products from osmanabad fruits and vegetables from bijapur or black rice from chandauli the exports of all of these are increasing now you will also find the world famous apricot of ladakh in dubai too and in saudi arabia you will find bananas shipped from tamil nadu most importantly an array of new products are being sent to ever newer countries for example the first consignment of millets grown in himachal and uttarakhand was exported to denmark bainganapalli and subarnarekha mangoes from krishna and chittoor districts of andhra pradesh were exported to south korea fresh jackfruits from tripura were exported to london by air and for the first time king chilli from nagaland was dispatched to london similarly the first consignment of bhalia wheat was exported from gujarat to kenya and sri lanka this means now if you go to other countries made in india products will be more visible than ever before friends this list is very long and the power of make in india is equivalent in might to the extent of the list equally great is the potential of india and the basis of its strength are our farmers artisans our weavers engineers our small entrepreneurs the msme sector people from many different professions all of them are its true strength it is only due to their hard work that the goal of exporting to the tune of 400 billion has been achieved and i am happy that this power of the people of india is now reaching new markets in every nook and corner of the world when each and every indian is vocal for local it does not take long for the local to become global let s make the local global and augment the prestige of our products further friends the listeners of mann ki baat will love to know that the success of our small entrepreneurs at the domestic level also makes us proud today our small entrepreneurs are playing a major partnership role in government procurement through government e market place i e gem a much transparent system has been developed through technology during the last one year through the gem portal the government has purchased items worth more than one lakh crore rupees close to 1 25 lakh small entrepreneurs small shopkeepers from every corner of the country have sold their goods directly to the government there was a time when only big companies could sell goods to the government however the country is changing now the old systems are also changing now even the smallest of shopkeepers can sell one s goods to the government on the gem portal this is the new india she not only dreams big but also shows the courage to reach that goal where no one has reached before on the basis of this very courage all of us indians together will definitely fulfill the dream of an aatmanirbhar bharat a self reliant india my dear countrymen you must have observed baba sivanand ji in the recently held padma awards ceremony seeing the agility of the 126 year old everyone must have been surprised just like i was and i saw before one could bat an eyelid he started bowing in the nandi mudra i bowed a number of times and offered pranaam to baba sivanand ji both the age of 126 years and the fitness of baba sivanand are the subject of discussion in the country today i read many people s comments on social media that baba sivanand is fitter than those one fourth his age indeed the life of baba sivananda is an inspiration for all of us i wish him a long life he has a passion for yoga and leads a very healthy lifestyle in our culture everyone is wished a hundred years of healthy life we will celebrate world health day on the 7th of april today the collective indian thought on health whether it is yoga or ayurveda is increasingly trending all over the world just last week you must have noticed a yoga program being organized in qatar in this citizens of 114 countries participated and made a new world record similarly the market of the ayush industry is also increasing continuously 6 years ago the market for medicines related to ayurveda was around 22 thousand crores today the ayush manufacturing industry is reaching around one lakh forty thousand crore rupees that is the possibilities are increasing continuously in this sector in the start up world too ayush is becoming a subject of attraction friends i have often referred to earlier on other start ups of the health sector but this time i will talk to you especially on ayush start ups there is a start up kapiva its meaning is hidden in its name here ka means kapha pi means pitta and va means vaata this start up is based on healthy eating habits in accordance with our traditions nirog street too is another start up which is a unique concept in the ayurveda healthcare ecosystem its technology driven platform connects ayurveda doctors from across the world directly to the people more than 50 thousand practitioners are associated with it similarly atreya innovations a healthcare technology start up is working in the field of holistic wellness ixoreal has not only spread awareness about the use of ashwagandha but has also invested a huge amount on top quality production process cureveda has created dietary supplements for holistic life through the confluence of modern herbal research and traditional knowledge friends i have listed only a few names so far this list is very long it is a symbol of the young entrepreneurs of india and the new possibilities being created in india i also have a request for the start ups of the health sector and especially the ayush start ups whatever portal you design online whatever content you create try to make it in all the languages recognized by the united nations there are many such countries in the world where english is neither spoken nor understood much promote your information keeping such countries in mind as well i am sure that soon ayush start ups from india with better quality products will reign all over the world friends health is also directly related to cleanliness in mann ki baat we always mention the efforts of the proponents of cleanliness one such swachhagrahi is chandrakishore patil ji he lives in nashik maharashtra chandrakishore ji s resolve regarding cleanliness is very heartfelt he stands by the godavari river and constantly encourages people not to throw garbage in the river if he sees someone doing this he immediately stops them chandrakishore ji invests a lot of his time in this endeavour by evening he has a pile of such things which people have brought to throw into the river this effort of chandrakishore ji also raises awareness and is also inspiring similarly there is another swachhagrahi rahul maharana of puri in orissa rahul goes to the pilgrimage sites in puri early in the morning every sunday and clears the plastic garbage there he has cleaned hundreds of kilos of plastic garbage and dirt so far be it rahul of puri or chandrakishore of nashik they teach us a lot as citizens we must carry out our duties whether it is cleanliness nutrition or vaccination all these efforts also help us in staying healthy my dear countrymen let s talk about mupattam sri narayanan ji of kerala he has started a project named pots for water of life when you come to know about this project you will marvel at the wonderful work done friends mupattam sri narayanan ji is running a campaign to distribute earthen pots so that animals and birds do not face water problems during summer in summer he used to get upset seeing the plight of animals and birds then he thought why not start distributing earthen pots himself so that others were left with only the task of filling water in those pots you will be surprised that the number of utensils distributed by narayanan ji is going to cross one lakh in his campaign he will donate the hundred thousandth pot to the sabarmati ashram established by gandhi ji today when the summer season has knocked at our doors this work of narayanan will definitely inspire all of us and we will also make arrangements for water for our animal and bird friends this summer friends i would also request the listeners of mann ki baat to reiterate our resolves whatever we can do to save every drop of water we must do that apart from this we have to keep giving equal emphasis on recycling of water the water used at home can be used in pots can be used in gardening it must be reused with a little effort you can make such arrangements in your home centuries ago rahimdas ji had purposefull said rahiman paani raakhiye bin paani sab soon and in this task of saving water i have high hopes from children just as our children made cleanliness a movement they can help save water by becoming a water warriors friends for centuries water conservation in our country protection of water sources has been part of the nature of society i am happy that many people in the country have made water conservation a life mission like arun krishnamurthy is a friend from chennai arun ji is running a campaign to clean the ponds and lakes in his area he took up the responsibility of cleaning more than 150 ponds and lakes and successfully completed it similarly there is a friend from maharashtra rohan kale rohan is an hr professional he is running a campaign to preserve hundreds of step wells in maharashtra many of these wells are centuries old and are part of our heritage bansilal pet kuan in secunderabad is one such step well due to years of neglect this step well got filled with mud and garbage but now the campaign to revive this step well has started with public participation friends i hail from a state where there has always been a shortage of water these step wells are called vav in gujarat vav has played a big role in a state like gujarat the jal mandir scheme played a significant role in the protection of these wells or step wells several step wells were revived all over gujarat this also helped a lot in raising the water level in these areas you can also run similar campaigns at the local level be it the construction of check dams or rain water harvesting individual efforts are also important in this and collective efforts are necessary too for instance at least 75 amrit sarovars can be made in every district of our country in the azadi ka amrit mahotsav some old lakes can be rejuvenated some new ones can be dug i am sure you will definitely make some effort in this direction my dear countrymen one of the beautiful aspects of mann ki baat is that i get your messages in many languages in many dialects many people also send audio message on mygov india s culture our languages our dialects our way of life our culinary range all of this diversity is our great strength from east to west from north to south this diversity binds india together leading to ek bharat shreshtha bharat here too both our historical sites and pauranik literature contribute a lot you must be wondering why i am mentioning this to you right now the reason for this is the madhavpur mela the listeners of mann ki baat will find it very interesting to know where the madhavpur mela is held why it is held how it is related to the diversity of india friends madhavpur mela is held in the village of madhavpur near the sea at porbandar in gujarat but it also connects with the eastern end of india you must be thinking how this is possible the answer to this also comes from a pauranik story it is said that thousands of years ago lord krishna was married to rukmani a princess from the north east this marriage took place in madhavpur porbandar and as a symbol of the that marriage even today madhavpur fair is held there this deep relationship between the east and west is our heritage with the passage of time with the efforts of the people new aspects too are now being added to the madhavpur fair in local parlance the bride s side is called gharati and now many gharaatis from the north east have started coming to this fair artists from all the states of the north east reach the madhavpur fair which lasts for a week when artisans associated with handicrafts arrive and the beauty of the fair is enhanced manifold for a week this amalgamation of cultures of the east and west of india the madhavpur fair creates a very beautiful example of ek bharat shrestha bharat i request you to read and know more about this fair as well my dear countrymen the azadi ka amrit mahotsav in the country is now becoming a new example of public participation a few days ago on the 23rd of march many celebrations were held in different corners of the country on martyrs day the country remembered te heroes and heroines of her independence remembered them reverently on the same day i also got the opportunity to dedicate to the nation the biplobi bharat gallery at victoria memorial kolkata this is a very unique gallery to pay tribute to the brave revolutionaries of india if you get n opportunity you must certainly visit it friends in the month of april we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of two great personalities both of them have left their deep impact on indian society these great personalities are mahatma phule and babasaheb ambedkar we will celebrate mahatma phule s birth anniversary on the 11th of april and babasaheb s birth anniversary on the 14th of april both of these great men fought persistently against discrimination and inequality mahatma phule opened schools for girls in that era raised his voice against female infanticide he also launched large campaigns to get rid of the water crisis friends the mention of savitribai phule ji is equally important in this reference to mahatma phule savitribai phule played a significant role in the formation of many social institutions as a teacher and a social reformer she also made the society aware and encouraged it together they founded the satyashodhak samaj they made efforts for the empowerment of the people we can clearly see the influence of mahatma phule in the work of babasaheb ambedkar he also used to say that the development of any society can be assessed by looking at the status of women in that society taking inspiration from the life of mahatma phule savitribai phule babasaheb ambedkar i request all the parents and guardians to ensure education for their daughters in order to increase the enrollment of daughters in schools the kanya shiksha pravesh utsav has also been started a few days ago the focus is on bringing back to school those girls who missed their studies for some reason friends it is a matter of good fortune for all of us that we have also got an opportunity to work for panch teerth associated with babasaheb be it his birthplace in mhow chaityabhoomi in mumbai his home in london the deeksha bhoomi in nagpur or babasaheb s maha parinirvana sthal in delhi i have had the privilege of visiting all the places all sacred sites i would urge the listeners of mann ki baat to visit the places associated with mahatma phule savitribai phule and

27-May-18,"In the May 27, 2018 edition of 'Mann Ki Baat,' Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauds the remarkable achievements of Indian women, such as the all-female naval team circumnavigating the globe and young climbers scaling Mount Everest. He emphasizes the importance of adventure, as it is closely linked to human progress, and acknowledges those who make daring accomplishments. He highlights the growing enthusiasm for the 'Fit India' campaign, aimed at promoting fitness and sports, with people across the nation participating. The Prime Minister stresses the significance of traditional sports and games, which not only contribute to physical health but also teach values and foster unity. He announces India's upcoming hosting of World Environment Day with the theme 'Beat Plastic Pollution' and encourages people to reduce their use of low-grade plastics. The Prime Minister advocates living in harmony with nature and reflects on the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, who promoted a deep connection with the environment. Lastly, he invites citizens to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21 and pays tribute to historical figures, including Veer Savarkar and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, marking their anniversaries.

Prakash Rao, a tea vendor running a school for underprivileged children, exemplifying the transformative power of dedication and altruism, and extends Eid greetings to all, hoping it strengthens social harmony.",27-may-2018 namaskar through mann ki baat i once again have been blessed with the opportunity to be face to face with you i am sure you distinctly remember that for the last many months a naval team comprising six women commanders was on a voyage i want to tell you something about the naavika saagar parikrama these six illustrious daughters of india circumnavigated the globe for over more than 250 days on board the insv tarini returning home on the 21st of may the entire country welcomed them with open arms with high spirits they traversed a multitude of oceans many a sea over a distance of almost twenty two thousand nautical miles this was a first of its kind event in the entire world last wednesday i got an opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences once again i congratulate these daughters and their spirit of adventure for bringing laurels to the country for raising the glory of the navy and significantly so for conveying to the world that india s daughters are no less who does not know of the sense of adventure if you view the journey of human evolution you will notice that breakthroughs in progress have taken birth in the womb of some adventure or the other there is an umbilical link between development and adventure the resolve to achieve something the burning desire to do something unparalleled the sentiment proclaiming i too can do it the number of such people may be miniscule but they turn out to be sources of inspiration for millions of others spanning an array of eras recently you must have come across quite a few notable happenings pertaining to mountaineers attempting to scale mount everest for centuries everest has been throwing the gauntlet at humankind and for long brave hearts have been responding to the challenge on the 16th of may a team comprising five tribal students of an ashram school in chandrapur maharashtra maneesha dhurve pramesh ale umakant madhavi kavidas katmode and vikas soyam scaled the world s highest peak these ashram school students began training in august 2017 covering wardha hyderabad darjeeling and leh ladakh these young boys girls had been selected under mission shaurya true to its name they brought glory to the country with their brave deed of conquering the everest i congratulate these young friends and members of the school in chandrapur from the core of my heart just a while ago 16 year old shivangi pathak became the youngest indian woman to scale everest from the nepal side heartiest congratulations beti shivangi ajit bajaj and his daughter became the first ever father daughter duo to ascend everest and it s not that only the young are climbing everest on the 19th of may sangeeta bahal aged more than 50 scaled the everest there are some mountaineers who have shown that apart from possessing skills they are sensitive too a few days ago under the clean ganga campaign a group from the bsf scaled the everest and while returning removed loads of trash littered there and brought it down this deed is commendable indeed it also displays their commitment towards cleanliness and the environment people have been ascending the everest for years many have managed to reach the peak successfully i congratulate these daredevils especially the daughters from the core of my heart my dear countrymen especially my young friends just a couple of months ago when i mentioned fit india i did not think it would draw such a good response that a large number of people would come forward to support it when i say fit india i believe that the more we play the more we will inspire the country to come out play people are sharing videos of fitness challenge on social media they are tagging each other to spread the challenge everybody is now getting connected with this fit india campaign people from the film fraternity from the world of sports common citizens of the country members of the armed forces school teachers or even those toiling in fields and farms their rising notes are building up a crescendo hum fit toh india fit if we are fit india is fit for me it s heartwarming that the captain of the indian cricket team virat kohli ji has included me in his challenge and i too have accepted his challenge i believe this is gainful and this kind of a challenge will inspire us to be fit alongwith others as well my dear countrymen many a time in mann ki baat you must have heard me mention a thing or two about sports sportspersons and in the last episode our heroes of the commonwealth games shared with us their mann ki baat matters close to their hearts through this programme chhavi yadav ji thank you very much for your phone call it is true that sports games that were once a part parcel of every child s life in every lane in the neighbourhood are fading into oblivion these games used to be a special feature of summer holidays sometimes in scorching afternoons at times after dinner children used to play with exuberant abandon for hours together leaving all worries behind some games saw the participation of the whole family aiming the ball at the crooked column of stone slats pitthoo playing marbles testing one s agility in kho kho spinning the top lattoo or applying skills in swiftly flicking the tapered edged wooden peg and hitting it aloft gilli danda innumerable games were an inseparable part of each every child s life from kashmir to kanyakumari from kutch to kamrup of course those games were known by different names depending on the place pitthoo is one such game some called it lagori at other places it was satoriya saat pathar dikori satodiya one game with many names traditional sports and games comprise both varieties outdoor and indoor as well the unity intrinsic to our country s diversity can be witnessed in these games a single game is known by distinct names at different places i am from gujarat i known of a game played in gujarat called chomal isto it is played with cowries or tamarind seeds or dice on an eight by eight square board it used to be played in almost every state known as chowkabara in karnataka attoo in madhya pradesh pakidakaali in kerala champal in maharashtra daayaam and thaayaam in tamilnadu changaa po in rajasthan it had innumerable names one realizes after playing despite not knowing the language of a particular state oh we used to play this game in our state as well who amongst us would not have enjoyed playing gilli danda in our childhood this is a game that is played across villages and cities it is also known by different names in andhra pradesh it is called gotibilla or karrabilla in odisha it s called gulibadi and in maharashtra vittidaaloo some games are seasonal there is a season for flying kites while flying a kite or playing a game one freely expresses one s inherent unique qualities you must have seen many a child shy by nature leap up with zest the moment a game begins even children with a seemingly serious countenance start expressing themselves while playing the innate child within them comes to the fore traditional sports and games are structured in such a manner that along with physical ability they enhance our logical thinking concentration alertness and energy levels games are not just games they teach us values in life such as setting targets building up determination developing team spirit and fostering mutual co operation i recently noticed in a training programme in business management our traditional sports and games being used for improving overall personality development and interpersonal skills these games are proving to be handy in overall development and then there is no prescribed age limit for participating in them from tiny tots to grandfather grandmother when we all play these games together then the term generation gap disappears on its own at the same time we also come to know about our culture and traditions many games also make us aware about our society environment and other spheres it is a matter of concern whether these sports games will fade away to the point of extinction it will not just be a loss of a game it will be the loss of the spirit of childhood something that will exist only in the verses of poetry ye daulat bhi le lo ye shohrat bhi le lo bhale chheen lo mujhse meri jawani magar mujhko lauta do bachpan ka sawan wo kagaz ki kashti wo baarish ka paani take away all my riches bereave me of all this fame snuff out my youth if you so wish but do return the monsoon that drenched me as a child the puddles my paper boats the magic of my rains and we will be forever reduced to listening to this song hence we must keep our traditional sports alive it is crucial that today schools neighbourhoods and youth congregations should come forward and promote these games through crowd sourcing we can create a very large archive of our traditional games the videos of these games can be shot outlining the way to play these games along with the mandatory rules and regulations animation films can also be made so that our young generations for whom these games played in our streets are something to marvel about can see play for themselves and thus bloom my dear countrymen on the 5th of june our nation india will officially host the world environment day celebrations this is a very important achievement for india and it is also an acknowledgement as well as recognition of india s growing leadership in the direction of tackling climate change this time the theme is beat plastic pollution i appeal to all of you that while trying to understand the importance of this theme we should all ensure that we do not use low grade polythene and low grade plastics and try to curb the negative impact of plastic pollution on our environment on our wild life and our health let us all visit the world environment day website wed india 2018 and try to imbibe and inculcate the many interesting suggestions given there into our everyday life whenever we face a torrid summer or floods incessant rains or unbearable cold everybody becomes an expert analyzing global warming and climate change but does empty talk bring about any solutions being sensitive towards nature protecting nature should come naturally to us these virtues should be embedded in our sanskar in the past few weeks we all witnessed that there were dust storms in the different regions of the country along with heavy winds and unseasonal heavy rains there was also loss of life and property these calamities are basically the result of the change in weather patterns our culture our traditions have never taught us to be at loggerheads with nature we have to live in harmony and in synchronicity with nature we have to stay in touch with nature mahatma gandhi had advocated this wisdom at every step of his life today when india speaks of climate justice or plays a major role in the cop21 and paris agreements or when we unite the whole world through the medium of international solar alliance they all are rooted in fulfilling that very dream of mahatma gandhi on this environment day let all of us give it a good thought as to what can we do to make our planet cleaner and greener how can we progress in this direction what innovative things can we do the rainy season is fast approaching we can set a target of achieving record plantation of trees this time and not only plant trees but also nurture and maintain the saplings till they grow my dear countrymen and especially my young friends you do remember the 21stof june now not only you and i june 21stremains a part of the entire world s collective consciousness the 21stof june has been mandated and is celebrated as the international yoga day in the entire world and people start preparing for it months in advance the news being received these days is that there are preparations afoot in the whole world to celebrate 21st june as international yoga day yoga for unity and a harmonious society conveys a message that has permeated the world over centuries ago the great sanskrit poet bhartahari had written in his shataktrayam s a man whose father is patience mother is forgiveness and peace as consort truth as his friend compassion as his sister and restraint for brother as family members and whose bed is the great earth is clothed by the great sky and whose food is only knowledge is indeed a yogi who won t know any fear thisobservation expressed centuries ago straightaway implies that practicing yogic exercises on a regular basis leads to imbibing benefic attributes which stand by our side like relatives and friends the practice of yoga leads to building up of courage which always protects us like a father the practice of yoga leads to germination of a sense of forgiveness in the same manner as a mother has for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend bhartahari has said that with regular yogic exercise truth becomes our child mercy becomes our sister self restraint our brother earth turns in to our bed and knowledge satiates our hunger when so many attributes become one s partner then that yogi conquers all forms of fear once again i appeal to all the citizens to adopt their legacy of yoga and create a healthy happy and harmonious nation my dear countrymen today is the 27thof may the death anniversary of the first prime minister of india pandit jawaharlal nehru ji i render my pranam to pandit ji memories of this month are also linked with veer savarkar this was the very month the month of may 1857 when indians had displayed their strength against the british in many parts of the country our youth and farmers demonstrated their bravery whilst standing up against the injustice it is indeed sad that we kept on calling the events of 1857 only as a rebellion or a soldiers mutiny for a very long time in fact may 1857 was not only evaluated as a minor historical incident but was also an attempt to dent our self respect it was veer savarkar who boldly expostulated by writing that whatever happened in 1857 was not a revolt but was indeed the first war of independence savarkaralong with his band of brave hearts celebrated the 50thanniversary of the first war of independence with great fanfare at india house in london it is also an amazing coincidence that the month which witnessed the first struggle for independence was the month in which veer savarkar ji was born savarkar ji s personality was full of special qualities he was a worshipper of both weapons or shashtra and knowledge or shaashtras generally veer savarkar is renowned for his bravery and his struggle against the british raj but besides these sterling qualities he was also a striking poet and a social reformer who always emphasized on goodwill and unity a wonderful account about savarkarji has been given by our dear honorable atal bihari vajpayee ji atal ji had said savarkar means brilliance savarkar means sacrifice savarkar means penance savarkar means substance savarkar means logic savarkar means youth savarkar means an arrow and savarkar means a sword behold what an accurate depiction of savarkar by atal ji savarkar marched alongwith both poetry and revolution besides being a sensitive poet he was also a courageous revolutionary my dear brothers and sisters i was watching a story on tv about our underprivileged daughters of certain slums in sikar rajasthan our daughters who were forced to sift through garbage and beg from home to home in order to earn a living today they are learning sewing and stitching clothes to cover the impoverished this is an example where the daughters are stitching ordinary to good quality clothes for themselves and other families along with this they are undergoing a training course in skill development these daughters have become self reliant today and are living their lives with respect and have become a strong support to their families i wish all these daughters brimming with hope and trust a very bright future they have demonstrated that if you have the desire to do something and if you are determined towards that goal then success can be achieved despite all odds and this is not only about sikar but in every corner of india you will witness something akin to this if you observe in your neighbourhood then you will witness for yourselves how people overcome the difficulties in their lives you must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop and enjoy tea there a discussion with some of the customers automatically ensues these discussions are also political and social in nature can be about movies sports and sportspersons or can focus even on the problems of the country any problem with probable solutions are discussed at length but often the problems and their solutions remain limited to such animated discussions only but there are some people who go ahead with their work to bring about a change through their hard work and dedication they make it a reality such is the story of d prakash rao living in the slums of cuttack orissa who gave up everything of his in order to adopt and realize the dreams of others just yesterday i ve had the good fortune of meeting d prakash rao shriman d prakash rao has been a tea vendor in the city of cuttack forthe past five decades a meagre tea vendor today you will be surprised to know that the lives of more than 70 children are being illuminated through education due to his efforts he has opened a school named asha ashvaasan spending 50 of his incomefor children living in slums and hutments he ensures education health and meals for all the children coming to this school i congratulate d prakash rao for his hard work his persistence and for providing a new direction to the lives of those poor children attending his school he has banished the darkness from their lives who amongst us does not know the vedic shloka tamso ma jyotirgamaya however it has been put intopractice by d prakash rao his life is an inspiration to us our society and the whole country your surroundings too must be full of such inspiring happenings there must be innumerable

27-Nov-16,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on November 27, 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his deep appreciation for the outpouring of support and creativity shown by the Indian people during Diwali as they celebrated with soldiers on the China border. He emphasized the need to keep the spirit of celebrating with the armed forces alive beyond special occasions, promoting unity and support for the military. PM Modi acknowledged the hardships faced by the public following the demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupee notes but lauded their cooperation and encouraged a move towards a cashless society, urging the youth to lead this transformation. He highlighted the positive effects of digital transactions, the role of small traders, and the impact of technology on rural areas. PM Modi also called on people to spread awareness and educate others about digital banking and cashless transactions to achieve this goal. Finally, he celebrated the birth anniversary of the renowned poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, whose son Amitabh Bachchan contributed to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan by offering a new slogan for the cleanliness campaign. PM Modi announced the broadcast of Mann Ki Baat in regional languages to reach even more people across the nation.",27-nov-2016 my dear countrymen namaskar last month all of us were celebrating diwali like every year this diwali too i had gone to the border to the china border to celebrate the occasion with our soldiers our jawans i celebrated diwali with itbp men and army jawans on the lofty heights of the himalayas i do it every time but this diwali was an entirely different experience the heartening effect of the novel way in which our 1 25 billion countrymen dedicated this diwali to soldiers of our army to our defence forces was clearly evident on their faces they appeared charged with emotions and not just that the act of our countrymen of sending greeting messages including the defence forces of the nation in their rejoicing had elicited a wonderful response and it is not that people merely sent messages there was an earnest heartfelt connect some wrote poems some drew pictures a few created cartoons others made videos it was as if every home had been transformed into an army post and when i saw those letters i used to be amazed at the magnitude of creativity and emotions behind this endeavour and this gave rise to a thought in mygov that out of these selected items could be compiled to make a coffee table book work is under way on that your collective contribution the sentiments of soldiers your emotional universe dedicated to our security forces as expressed in your creativity will form the content of this volume a soldier wrote to me mr prime minister we soldiers have all the festivals like holi and diwali on the borders we are devoted to defending the country every moment bu we do miss our near and dear ones back home during festivals but to tell you the truth this time we did not feel so never did it appear to us even once that we are not at home for the festivities it felt as if we were celebrating diwali together with a hundred and twenty five crore indians my dear countrymen this warmth of emotion this fervour that has been kindled in the hearts of our defence forces our soldiers this diwali should this be confined to only a few occasions i appeal to you that we should make it our nature our characteristic as a society as a nation that whether it be a celebration of a festival or any joyous occasion we should keep the soldiers the jawans of the military of our nation in our hearts and minds when the entire nation stands by the armed forces their might mutiplies a hundred and twenty five crore times a few days ago all pradhans from the villages of jammu kashmir had come to see me they were from the jammu kashmir panchayat conference they had come from different villages of the kashmir valley there were around 40 50 pradhans i got an opportunity to speak to them at length they had come to discuss a few points on the development of their villages they had some demands but when the deliberations began issues such as conditions in the valley the law and order situation the future of children came up in a natural manner these village pradhans spoke about these topics with such affection and openness that everything touched my heart in the course of the conversation there was also a mention of schools in kashmir that had been set afire and i felt these pradhans were as saddened as our other countrymen were at that they too felt that it was not just schools it was the future of the children that had been set ablaze i had urged them to focus on these children s future on their return home i am feeling happy today that these pradhans who had come from the kashmir valley kept their word in letter and spirit they returned to their villages and made people from far and wide aware on this issue recently just a few days ago when the board examinations were held 95 of the sons and daughters of kashmir the young students appeared in the examinations the sheer volume of students who appeared in the board examinations is a clear indication that our children from jammu kashmir are committed to attain newer heights of progress to build a bright future through the medium of education for their resolute zeal i congratulate these students and i also felicitate their parents their kith and kin their teachers and all the gram pradhans as well from the depths of my heart my dear brothers and sisters this time when i asked people for suggestions for mann ki baat i can say that almost all the suggestions that were received echoed one theme everyone wanted me to speak in more detail about the 500 1000 rupee notes on the 8th of november at 8 in the evening in my address to the nation i had talked about launching a mega campaign to bring about reforms in the country when i had taken this decision and presented it before you then also i had said openly that it was not an ordinary decision it was one fraught with difficulties it was a very important decision but implementation of that decision is equally important and i had also foreseen that this would result in all of us having to face various new difficulties in our day to day lives and i had stated then also that this decision was so enormous that it would take us at least 50 days to come out of its after effects and only then would we be able to move towards normalcy these maladies have been afflicting us for the past 70 years and the campaign for getting rid of these can never be an easy task i can very well understand the problems you are going through but when i see your support when i look at your co operation although numerous efforts are on to misguide you despite that and despite witnessing some disturbing incidents you have whole heartedly comprehended the path of righteousness and truth you have favourably accepted this step taken in the best national interest 500 and 1000 rupee notes and such a vast country wide proliferation of currencies billions and trillions of bank notes and amidst that this decision the whole world is minutely observing every economist is analysing it evaluating it the whole world is watching will hundred and twenty five crore indians finally attain success after facing numerous hardships this question may be there in the world community however india has nothing but faith and faith only and supreme confidence in her hundred and twenty five crore countrymen that they will certainly fulfill their resolve and our country will emerge shining like gold does after a test by fire and the reason for that is you the citizens of this country the route to this success also has been paved only because of you across the country central government state governments all units of the local self government institutions one lakh thirty thousand bank branches lakhs of bank employees over one and a half lakh post offices over a lakh bank mitras are relentlessly at work day and night with complete dedication in the midst of immense and varied stress all these individuals are working hard maintaining a calm and composed demeanour taking it as a yagya of service to the nation an attempt towards a great transformation they begin work early in the morning not knowing when they will wind up at night everyone is busy working and as a precise consequence of this diligence there are clear indications that india will succeed handsomely in this endeavour and i have seen that in the midst of such difficulties all personnel of banks and post offices are working very hard and when it comes to the practice of humanity they appear two steps ahead someone told me that in khandwa an old gentleman met with an accident money was needed urgently this came to the knowledge of local bank personnel and i was happy to learn that they personally carried and handed over cash at his home for help in treatment innumerable such incidents come to light everyday through television media newspapers and mutual conversations i profusely thank all such compatriots who have striven hard to perform this mahayagya and lived up to the lofty virtue of purusharth the greatest validation of shakti strength comes when the same is put to test i distinctly remember when the prime minister s jan dhan yojana was launched bank personnel earnestly and zealously shouldered their responsibilities and showed that they could achieve what had not been accomplished during the last 70 years their capabilities were manifested today once again they have accepted the challenge and i do believe that the steely resolve of one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen their collective demonstration of purusharth will go a long way in investing our nation with a new power and strength on its path of progress but vices are so widespread and deep rooted that even today there are people whose vicious habits refuse to die even now some people think that they can re introduce into the system money from corruption black money unaccounted wealth and benami money money in unknown person s name using some route or the other they seek illegal means to save their ill gotten wealth the saddest part is that for this too they have chosen to misuse the poor the underprivileged people by misguiding the poor enticing them through the vices of avarice and temptation wrongfully pumping money into their bank accounts or getting them to undertake some wrong activities some people are trying to save their black money i want to tell such people today whether you reform or not is up to you whether you respect and follow the law or do otherwise is again up to you of course the law will take its own course to decide on the requisite action but for god s sake please do not play with the lives of poor people do not do anything that may bring the names of the poor on record for wrong reasons and land my dear poor people into trouble during the investigation later on account of your foul deeds and the law regarding benami property that has been enacted and is being implemented is very stringent and it is going to be extremely tough on wrong doers the government does not wish that our countrymen should face undue hardships one mr aashish has called me up and appreciated the fight against corruption and black money through the action on 500 and 1000 rupee notes sir namaste my name is aashish paare i am an ordinary citizen of village tiraali of tehsil tiraali in district harda of madhya pradesh your move to demonetize 1000 and 500 rupee notes is a commendable step i wish that in mann ki baat you quote instances of people who despite facing hardships have welcomed this step for the nation s progress this will further enhance people s zeal a cashless economy is necessary for nation building and i am with the whole country on this i am truly happy that you have done away with 1000 and 500 rupee notes i have received a similar call from mr yellappa velankar ji from karnataka modi ji namaste i am calling from a village in koppal district of karnataka my name is yellappa velankar i want to thank you wholeheartedly because you had said that good days will come but nobody had ever thought that you would take such a big step you have taught a lesson to black money mongers and the corrupt through the demonetization of 1000 and 500 rupee notes for each and every citizen of india there could be no better days than these for this i thank you from the core of my heart we get to know certain things through media through the people and through government sources which add to our enthusiasm for work it gives us such a great happiness and a sense of pride to know that the common man in my country has such a wonderful capability a restaurant on the national highway 6 in akola in maharashtra has displayed a board saying that if you have only old currency notes in the pocket and want to have food please do not worry about money and do not leave hungry from this place please do have your food and pay later whenever you happen to pass through this place so people go and eat there and make payments on their next visit after 2 4 or 6 days this is the strength of my country which encompasses the spirit of service of sacrifice and also of genuineness and honesty during elections i used to have that is discussions over tea and this got publicised around the whole world people in many countries of the world even learnt to utter the phrase chai par charcha but i did not know chai par charcha could be linked to a marriage also i learnt that on 17th november a marriage was solemnised with chai par charcha in surat one daughter at surat in gujarat served only tea to all the guests who had come to her wedding there was no big function no feast or banquet because there was a shortage of cash due to demonetisation guests from the bridegroom s side also gracefully accepted it as their ceremonial welcome bharat maaroo and dakshaa parmar from surat through their marriage have made a valuable contribution in the ongoing fight against corruption and black money and set up a very inspiring example i convey my blessings to the newlyweds bharat and dakshaa and profusely compliment them also for having transformed their wedding occasion into an offering for the great task and thereby converting it into a new opportunity whenever confronted by such difficult times people do succeed in exploring and finding good avenues and solutions i once saw in the news on tv when i had returned late in the night a report about a small village called dhekiajulli in assam where tea workers reside these tea workers get their wages on weekly basis now what they did when they received a 2000 rupee note as wages four women from the neighborhood got together and jointly made purchases and made the payment with the 2000 rupee note they did not need small currency as they had jointly made their purchases and had decided that they would settle accounts later when they were to meet next week people are themselves finding ways and just look at this change the government received a message that people of tea gardens in assam are demanding setting up of atms in their areas see how the village life is also getting transformed some people are getting instant benefits from this campaign the nation will reap these benefits in the days to come but some people have got benefits instantly on asking how things were going on i got to know about the impact in small towns on the basis of reports received from about 45 50 cities i gathered that demonetisation had encouraged people there to pay their arrears accumulated due to non payment of dues earlier many people were in the habit of not making tax payments such as water tax electricity bills etc they just did not pay now all of us know very well that the poor people always like to clear their dues 2 3 days in advance it is the well off people who do not pay their taxes and bills as they have higher connections and know that nobody is going to ask or do anything against them thus there are big arrears of payments which remain pending all municipalities receive hardly 50 of their tax revenues but this time after the decision taken on the 8th instant people rushed to deposit their old currency notes 47 urban institutions had received about 3 to 3 5 thousand crore rupees in taxes last year you will be surprised and also happy to know that during this one week these institutions received 13 thousand crore rupees imagine the difference from 3 to 3 5 thousand crores to 13 thousand crores and that too with the self initiative of those making payments now that these municipalities have received 4 times the money it is quite natural that poor localities and slums will get better drainage facilities better water supply and better aanganbari system many such examples are coming to light where direct benefits of this demonetisation can clearly be seen brothers and sisters our villages and our farmers are strong pillars of our economy every citizen is making requisite adjustments amidst the difficulties as a result of the new changes but i especially wish to compliment the farmers of our country i was just gathering data of the sowing of this crop season i am glad that be it wheat be it pulses be it oilseeds the data received till 20th november indicates that sowing has increased substantially as compared to sowing during the last year our farmers have discovered new avenues amidst the present difficulties the government has also taken many important decisions wherein priority has been accorded to our farmers and villages despite these measures some difficulties persist but i am confident that our farmer who bravely faces every difficulty including natural calamities is standing firm in the face of present odds also small traders and businessmen of our country provide employment opportunities besides adding to the economic activities in the last budget we had taken an important decision that just like the big malls small shopkeepers in the villages will also be allowed to operate round the clock and no rule will stop them from doing so because i felt that when the big malls can function 24 hours why the poor village shopkeepers should not get the same facility a number of initiatives were taken to grant them loans under mudra yojana these small traders were provided loans worth lakhs and crores of rupees under mudra yojana because there are crores of such small traders and they impart momentum to the business activities worth billions of rupees but naturally they too had to face difficulties due to this decision however i have seen that these small businessmen too have kept providing services to their customers in their own ways through the use of technology such as mobile app mobile bank and credit card and on the basis of mutual trust also and i want to tell our small trader brothers and sisters that this is a ripe opportunity for them too to make their entry into the digital world you too download apps of banks on your mobile phones you too keep a pos machine for transactions in credit cards you too learn to do cashless business you can see how the big malls are expanding their business with the help of latest technology a small trader can also expand the business with the help of this user friendly technology there is no possibility of things going wrong but there certainly is an opportunity to grow i invite you all you can make a very big contribution in creating a cashless society you can create a full fledged banking facility on your mobile phone and there are many ways now to run our business without using paper currency there are technological methods which are safe secure and instantaneous i want that you not only extend your cooperation in making this campaign successful but also lead the process of transformation and i have full confidence that you can be the leader for this change i am sure you can handle the entire business in your village using this technology i want to tell my worker brothers and sisters too that you have faced heavy exploitation wages shown on paper are much higher than the wages actually paid to you if sometimes full wages are paid someone stands outside to forcibly take his cut and the worker is compelled to accept this as his fate we want that under this new system you should have a bank account your wages should be deposited directly into your bank so that payment of minimum wages is ensured you get your due wages in full without anybody extracting a cut no one should exploit you and once the money is credited into your bank account you can use your mobile phone as an e wallet and you do not need any hi fi smart phone for this because even with the help of your ordinary mobile phone itself you can make purchases from the neighbourhood shops and make payments as well that is why i specially urge our worker brothers and sisters to participate in this scheme because after all i took such a momentous decision for the benefit of the poor people the farmers the workers the deprived and the suffering people of the country and hence these benefits must reach them i specially want to talk to our young friends today we keep telling with great fanfare the whole world that india is a country where 65 of the population is below the age of 35 years i know dear young men and women of my country that you have liked my decision i also know that you support my decision i even know that you are making a big contribution in positively taking this mission forward but dear friends you are my true soldiers my true partners we have got a wonderful chance to serve our mother india and to take our country to new economic heights dear youngsters can you please help me you will be with me but that alone is not enough the older generation does not have the exposure and experience of the new world which you possess possibly your elder brother and even your parents and uncles and aunts also may not know you know what an app is what online banking is and how online ticket booking is done for you these are routine things and you also make use of them but the great task that the country wants to accomplish today is the realisation of our dream of a cashless society it is true that a hundred percent cashless society is not possible but why should india not make a beginning in creating a less cash society once we embark on our journey to create a less cash society the goal of cashless society will not remain very far and i require your physical help your own time your own resolve and i am sure that you will not disappoint me because we are the ones nurturing the desire to change for better the life of the poor people of india you know how many opportunities there are today for a cashless society for digital banking or for mobile banking every bank provides online banking facility every bank in india has its own mobile app every bank has its wallet wallet simply means an e purse various types of cards are available under jan dhan yojana crores of poor families in india have rupay cards used scarcely earlier after 8th november the poor people have started using rupay cards and this usage has seen almost 300 surge just as there is a prepaid card for mobile phones prepaid cards are also available in banks to facilitate expenditure upi is a very useful platform for carrying on trade activities which enables you to make purchases send money and even receive money and this procedure is as simple as sending messages through whatsapp even an illiterate person today knows how to send and also forward whatsapp messages not only this with the simplification of technology we do not require any big smart phones for this purpose cash can be transferred even with a phone with ordinary features a washerman vegetable vendor milk supplier newspaper vendor tea stall owner or a chanaa vendor everyone can easily use this facility i have provided further impetus to simplifying this system even more all banks are engaged in this and are doing their best we have now cancelled the online surcharge and you might have seen in the newspapers during last 2 4 days that all extra charges for such cards have been abolished in order to strengthen the movement towards achieving a cashless society my dear young friends despite all these things there is an entire generation which is ignorant in these matters and i know it very well that all of you are actively contributing in this great task the kind of creative messages that you send on whatsapp slogans poems anecdotes cartoons new imagination jokes i am seeing all these signifying the creative power of our young generation amidst the present challenges this is the speciality of our bharat bhoomi our motherland where gita was created on a battlefield today when we are passing through the times of such gigantic changes your original creativity is manifesting itself within you but my dear young friends i once again tell you that i need your help in this task yes yes yes i repeat that i need your help and i am very sure that millions of young people of our country will accomplish this tremendous task you just do one thing take a resolve today itself that you will yourself become a part of the cashless society every technology needed for online spending will definitely be available on your mobile phone but not only this you must devote half an hour one hour or two hours daily to educate at least 10 families about what this technology is how this technology is to be used how to download the apps of your banks how to spend money from one s account how to make payment to shopkeepers also teach the shopkeepers to conduct their business with this technology you have to voluntarily lend your leadership to this great campaign this maha abhiyan to create a cashless society to eradicate corruption from our country to abolish the scourge of black money and to help people in overcoming their difficulties and problems once you teach the poor people about the usage of rupay card they will shower their blessings upon you when you teach the common citizen these new techniques he will probably become free from all his worries and if all the young people of india join in this great endeavour i don t think it will take much time we can emerge and take our place in the world as a new modern india within a period of one month and you can do this through your mobile phone by going to 10 houses daily and bringing 10 families daily under the ambit of this campaign i invite you come do not just support this transformation but become one of its leading soldiers and ensure that we achieve the desired transformation we shall carry forward this struggle to free our country from the evils of corruption and black money there are many countries in the world where the youth have changed the nation s life and it has to be accepted that it is the youth which brings

occasion today shriman amitabh bachchan ji has given a slogan for swachhta mission you must have noticed that amitabh ji the most popular actor of this century has been whole heartedly promoting the

privilege of launching the g 20 logo and the website of the presidency of india this logo was chosen through a public contest when i received this gift sent by hariprasad garu another thought came to my mind i was very happy to see how connected even a person sitting in a district of telangana could feel with a summit like g 20 today many people like hariprasad garu have sent letters to me saying that their hearts have swelled with pride at the country hosting such a big summit i will also mention to you the message of subba rao chillara ji from pune and tushar jagmohan from kolkata they have highly appreciated india s pro active efforts regarding g 20 friends the g 20 has a partnership comprising two thirds of the world s population three fourths of world trade and 85 of world gdp you can

would also urge schools colleges and universities to create opportunities for discussions debates and competitions related to g 20 in their respective places if you go to the g20 in website you will find many things there according to your interest my dear countrymen on the 18th of november the whole country witnessed new history being made in the space sector on this day india sent its first such rocket into space which was designed and prepared by the private sector of india the name of this rocket is vikram s as soon as this first rocket of the indigenous space start up made a historic flight from sriharikota the heart of every indian swelled with pride friends vikram s rocket is equipped with many features it is also lighter than other rockets and also cheaper its development cost is much less than the cost incurred by other countries involved in space missions in space technology world class standard at a low cost has now become the hallmark of india another modern technology has been used in making this rocket you will be surprised to know that some crucial parts of this rocket have been made through 3d printing surely the name prarambh given to the launch mission of vikram s suits it perfectly this marks the dawn of a new era for the private space sector in india this is the beginning of a new era full of self confidence for the country you can imagine the children who once made paper airplanes and used to fly them with their hands are now getting a chance to make airplanes in india itself you can imagine those children who once used to draw shapes in the sky looking at the moon and stars are now getting a chance to make rockets in india itself after space was opened to the private sector these dreams of the youth are also coming true as if these youth making rockets are saying sky is not the limit friends india is sharing its success in the space sector with its neighbouring countries as well just yesterday india launched a satellite which has been jointly developed by india and bhutan this satellite will send pictures of very good resolution which will help bhutan in the management of its natural resources the launching of this satellite is a reflection of the strong indo bhutan relations friends you must have noticed that in the last few episodes of mann ki baat we discussed a lot on space tech innovation there are two special reasons for this one is that our youth are doing wonderful work in this field they are thinking big and achieving big now they are not going to be satisfied with small achievements secondly in this exciting journey of innovation and value creation they are also encouraging their other young colleagues and start ups friends when we are talking about innovations related to technology how can we forget drones india is also moving fast in the field of drones a few days ago we saw how apples were transported through drones in kinnaur himachal pradesh kinnaur is a remote district of himachal and there is heavy snowfall in this season with this much snowfall kinnaur s connectivity with the rest of the state becomes very difficult for weeks in such a situation the transportation of apples from there is equally difficult now with the help of drone technology delicious kinnauri apples of himachal will start reaching people more quickly this will reduce the expenditure of our farmer brothers and sisters apples will reach the market on time there will be less wastage of apples friends today our countrymen are making things possible with their innovations which could not even be imagined earlier who would not be happy to see this in recent years our country has undertaken a long journey of achievements i have full faith that we indians and especially our young generation are not going to stop now dear countrymen i am going to play a small clip for you song all of you must have heard this song sometime or the other after all this is bapu sfavorite song but if i tell you that the singers who have sung it are from greece you will definitely be surprised and this will also fill you with pride this song has been sung by the singer from greece konstantinos kalaitzis he had sung it during the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of gandhiji but today i am discussing him for some other reason he has a great passion for india and indian music he has so much affection for india that in the last 42 forty two years he has come to india almost every year he has studied about the origin of indian music different indian musical systems different types of ragas talas and rasas as well as different gharanas he has studied the contribution of many great personalities of indian music he has also closely understood the different aspects of classical dances of india now he has put together all these experiences related to india very beautifully in a book there are about 760 pictures in his book named indian music most of these photographs have been taken by he himself such enthusiasm and fascination for indian culture in other countries is really heartening friends a few weeks ago another news came which is going to fill us with pride you will be pleased to know that in the last 8 years the export of musical instruments from india has increased three and a half times talking about electrical musical instruments their export has increased 60 times this shows that the craze for indian culture and music is increasing all over the world the biggest buyers of indian musical instruments are developed countries like usa germany france japan and uk it is a matter of fortune for all of us that our country has such a rich heritage of music dance and art friends we all know the great sage poet bhartrihari for his niti shatak in one of the verses he says that one s attachment to art music and literature is the real identity of humanity in fact our culture takes it above humanity to divinity in the vedas samaveda has been called the source of our diverse music be it the veena of maa saraswati the flute of bhagwan krishna or the damru of bholenath our gods and goddesses are also attached with music we indians find music in everything be it the murmur of a river the raindrops the chirping of birds or the resonating sound of the wind music is present everywhere in our civilization this music relaxes not only the body but also gives joy to the mind music also connects our society if bhangra and lavani have a sense of fervor and joy rabindra sangeet lifts our souls tribals across the country have different musical traditions they inspire us to live in harmony with each other and with nature friends our forms of music have not only enriched our culture but have also left an indelible mark on the music of the world the fame of indian music has spread to every corner of the world let me play to you one more audio clip song you must be thinking that bhajan kirtan is being performed in some temple in the neighbourhood but these notes have reached you from guyana a south american country thousands of miles away from india in the 19th and 20th centuries a large number of people from here went to guyana they also took many traditions of india with them from here for example as we celebrate holi in india in guyana also the colors of holi come alive with zest where there are colors of holi there is also the music of phagwa that is phagua in phagwa of guyana there is a special tradition of singing wedding songs associated with bhagwan rama and bhagwan krishna these songs are called chautal they are sung on the similar type of tune and at a high pitch as we do here not only this chautal competitions are also held in guyana similarly many indians especially people from eastern uttar pradesh and bihar had gone to fiji too they used to sing traditional bhajan kirtans mainly couplets from the ramcharitmanas they also formed many mandalis associated with bhajan kirtan in fiji even today there are more than two thousand bhajan kirtan mandalis in fiji by the name of ramayana mandali today they can be seen in every village and locality i have given only a few examples here if you see in the whole world then this list of lovers of indian music is very long my dear countrymen we all always take pride in the fact that our country is home to the oldest traditions in the world therefore it is also our responsibility to preserve our traditions and traditional knowledge to promote it and to take it forward as much as possible one such commendable effort is being made by some friends of our northeastern state of nagaland i liked this effort very much so i thought i d share it with the listeners of mann ki baat friends the lifestyle of the naga community in nagaland their art culture and music attracts everyone it is an important part of the glorious heritage of our country the life of the people of nagaland and their skills are also very important for a sustainable life style in order to save these traditions and skills and pass them on to the next generation the people there have formed an organization that s name is lidi cro u the organization has undertaken the work of reviving beautiful facets of naga culture which were on the verge of being lost for example naga folk music is a very rich genre in itself this organization has started the work of launching naga music albums so far three such albums have been launched these people also organize workshops related to folk music and folk dance youth are also given training for all these not only this the youth are also trained in the traditional nagaland style of apparel making tailoring and weaving many types of products are made from bamboo in the northeast the youth of the new generation are also taught to make bamboo products with this these youth not only get connected with their culture but also create new employment opportunities for them people at lidi cro u try to make more and more people know about naga folk culture friends there will be such cultural styles and traditions in your region too you too can make such efforts in your respective areas if you are aware of any such unique effort being made somewhere then you must share that information with me as well my dear countrymen we it has been said here vidyadhanam sarva dhanam pradhanam that is if someone is donating knowledge then he is doing the noblest work in the interest of the society even a small lamp lit in the field of education can illuminate the whole society it gives me great pleasure to see that many such efforts are being made across the country today bansa is a village in hardoi 70 80 kilometres away from lucknow the capital of up i have come to know about jatin lalit singh ji of this village who is engaged in kindling the flame of education jatin ji had started a community library and resource centre here two years ago his centre has more than 3000 books related to hindi and english literature computer law and preparing for many government exams in this library the choice of the children has also been taken full care of whether it is comic books or educational toys present here children are very fond of them small children come here to learn new things while playing be it offline or online education about 40 volunteers are busy guiding the students at this center everyday about 80 students of the village come to study in this library friends sanjay kashyap ji of jharkhand is also giving new wings to the dreams of poor children in his student life sanjay ji had to face the paucity of good books in such a situation he decided that he would not let the future of the children of his region be dark due to lack of books because of this mission today he has become the library man for children in many districts of jharkhand when sanjay ji had started working he had got the first library built at his native place wherever he was transferred during his job he would get involved in the mission of opening a library for the education of poor and tribal children while doing this he has opened libraries for children in many districts of jharkhand his mission to open a library is taking the form of a social movement today be it sanjay ji or jatin ji i especially appreciate them for their myriad such efforts my dear countrymen the world of medical science has made a lot of progress with the help of research and innovation as well as state of the art technology and equipment but some diseases even today remain a big challenge for us one such disease is muscular dystrophy it is mainly a genetic disease that can occur at any age in which the muscles of the body begin to weaken it becomes difficult for the patient to do even his small tasks of daily life the treatment and care of such patients require great sense of service we have such a centre at solan in himachal pradesh which has become a new ray of hope for the patients of muscular dystrophy the name of this centre is manav mandir it is being run by the indian association of muscular dystrophy manav mandir is a wonderful example of human service true to its name opd and admission services for the patients started here three four years ago manav mandir also has the facility of beds for about 50 patients along with physiotherapy electrotherapy and hydrotherapy diseases are also treated here with the help of yoga pranayama friends through all kinds of hi tech facilities this centre also tries to bring a positive change in the lives of the patients a challenge associated with muscular dystrophy is also a lack of awareness about it that s why this centre organizes awareness camps for patients not only in himachal pradesh but across the country the most encouraging thing is that the management of this organization is mainly done by people suffering from this disease like social worker urmila baldi ji president of indian association of muscular dystrophy sister sanjana goyal ji and other members of this association shriman vipul goyal ji who played an important role in the formation is playing a very important role for this institution efforts are also on to develop manav mandir as a hospital and research centre with this patients will be able to get better treatment here i heartily appreciate all the people trying in this direction as well as wish the best for recovery of all the people suffering from muscular dystrophy my dear countrymen the creative and social endeavours of the countrymen that we discussed in today s mann ki baat are examples of the country s energy and enthusiasm today every countryman is trying to do something different for the country in one field or the other at every level in today s discussion itself we saw that in an international event like g 20 one of our weaver companions understood his responsibility and came forward to fulfil it similarly some are making efforts for the environment others are working for water many people are doing extraordinary work from education medicine and science technology to culture traditions this is because today every citizen of ours is realising one s duties when such a sense of duty rises within the citizens of a nation its golden future is automatically ensured and in the golden future of the country itself also lies for all of us a golden future i once again salute the countrymen for their efforts we will meet again next month and will definitely talk about many more such encouraging topics do keep sending your suggestions and ideas many thanks to all of you sharing this month s mannkibaat it is a

episode of mann ki baat we had decided to do something different this diwali i had urged all of you to celebrate india s nari shakti the power and achievement of women thereby felicitating the lakshmi of india and within no time there followed a slew of innumerable inspirational stories on social media kodipaka ramesh from warangal has written on namo app my mother is my strength in 1990 when my

dear countrymen the well known 17th century poetess sanchi honnamma has penned a poem in kannada that embodies the same thought the same words pertaining to every lakshmi of india that we referred to one feels the foundation of the idea was laid in the 17th century itself you will notice the beauty of word sentiment and thought in this poem in kannada penninda permegondanu himavantanu penninda broohu perchidanu penninda janakaraayanu jasuvalendanu which means himwant lord mount attained fame on account of daughter parvati rishi brighu on account of his daughter lakshmi and king janak because of daughter sita our daughters are our pride their prodigious virtuosity cradles our social fabric ensuring its bright future my dear countrymen the 12th of november 2019 is the day when the 550th prakashotsav of guru nanak dev ji will be celebrated across the world the luminescence of guru nanak dev ji s influence can be felt not only in india but around the world many of our sikh brothers and sisters settled in other countries committedly follow guru nanak dev ji s ideals i can never forget my visits to gurudwaras in vancouver and tehran there is much about guru nanak dev ji that i can share with you but it will require many an episode of mann ki baat he accorded the highest significance to the spirit of service guru nank dev ji firmly believed that any service done selflessly was beyond evaluation he stood firm against social ills such as untouchability sri guru nanak dev ji radiated his message to all corners of the world he was the widest travelled of those times and wherever he went he won hearts through his straightforwardness humility and simplicity guru nanak ji undertook many significant spiritual journeys called udaasi carrying the message of harmony and equality he travelled north south east and west meeting people saints and sages it is said that the revered assamese saint shankar dev too was inspired by him he also travelled to the holy land of haridwar there is a holy place in kashi named gurubagh gurudwara it is believed that guru nanak dev ji had halted there he also went to buddhist holy sites such as rajgir and gaya his journeys to the south took him to sri lanka as well during his yatra to bidar karnataka he devised a solution for water woes the place was grappling with gurunanak jhira sahib is a famous place in bidar dedicated to him cherishing reminiscences of him during one udaasi gurunanak dev ji travelled north to kashmir and neighboring areas this forged a strong bond between sikh followers and kashmir guru nanak dev ji also went to tibet where people accorded him the status of a guru he is revered in uzbekistan too which he had visited during one udaasi he widely travelled to islamic countries including saudi arabia iraq and afghanistan he secured a revered place in the hearts of millions who followed his messages with complete devotion a practice that continues even in the present times just a few days ago ambassadors of approximately eighty five countries went to amritsar from delhi there in the golden temple itself they undertook a holy darshan commemorating the 550th prakash parv of guru nanak devji besides darshan all these ambassadors had the opportunity to know more about sikh traditions and culture following that many ambassadors shared those photos on social media writing about their glorious experiences it s my devout wish to imbibe guru nanak dev ji s thoughts and ideals into our lives may we be all the more inspired to make it happen my dear brothers and sisters i am sure all of you remember the significance of the 31st of october this day marks the birth anniversary of the iron man of india sardar vallabhbhai patel the unifying force in bonding us as a nation our hero on the one hand sardar patel possessed the rare quality of uniting people on the other he was able to strike a balance with people who were not in ideological agreement with him sardar patel used to observe even the minutest of things in depth assessing and evaluating them simultaneously he was a man of detail in the true sense of the term along with that he was also adept at organising skills chalking out plans and devising strategies was his core forte when we read and hear about sardar saheb s style of working we come to know of the sheer magnitude of the meticulousness in his planning in 1921 in the congress session in ahmedabad thousands of delegates from across the country were slated to participate sardar patel was entrusted with overlooking all the arrangements he utilized this opportunity in improving the city s water supply network he ensured that not a single person would face a problem on account of water not just that he was also concerned about the safety and security of the delegates shoes and baggage to ensure that what he did will surprise you he contacted farmers and urged them to craft khadi bags these were made and sold to the delegates they carried the bags with their shoes inside free from any tension of the footwear getting stolen on the other hand it led to a major rise in the sale of khadi our country will always be indebted to sardar patel for his steller role in the constituent assembly he strove to ensure enshrinement of fundamental rights that obliterated any possibility of discrimination on the basis of caste and community friends all of us know that as india s first home minister sardar patel undertook the colossal historic task of integrating princely states scrutinizing the minutest of events closely was his rare quality on the one hand he concentrated on hyderabad junagarh and other states on the other he was watching far flung lakshadweep intently actually when we refer to sardar patel s endeavour his role in the unification of just a few notable states is discussed he played a far more significant role when it came to a small region such as lakshadweep too lakshadweep is one of the most beautiful landscapes in india soon after partition in 1947 our neighbour had cast an eye on lakshadweep a ship bearing their flag was sent there when sardar patel was informed of this he wasted no time in initiating stern action he urged the mudaliar brothers arcot ramaswamy mudaliar and arcot laxman swamy mudaliar to immediately undertake a mission with people of travancore to lakshadweep and take the lead in unfurling the tricolour there following his orders the tricolour was promptly unfurled there and the nefarious dreams of the neighbour of annexing lakshadweep were decimated within no time after this incident sardar patel asked the mudaliar brothers to personally ensure all assistance for development of lakshadweep today lakshadweep is contributing significantly in india s progress it is an attractive tourist destination too i hope you get the opportunity to visit the picturesque islands and its pristine beaches my dear countrymen the 31st of october 2018 is the day when the statue of unity in memory of sardar saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world it is the tallest statue in the world it is double in height compared to the statue of liberty located in the us the distinction of having the world s highest statue fills every indian with pride the head of every indian is held high you will be happy to note that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists visited the statue of unity this means that an average of eight and a half thousand people witnessed the grandeur of the statue of unity every day the reverence and devotion for sardar vallabhbhai patel in their hearts was reflected in the form of homage paid to him besides at present it houses many centres of attraction such as cactus garden butterfly garden jungle safari and children s nutrition park ekta nursery which are all constantly evolving and providing a fillip to the local economy local people are not only getting innovative opportunities of employment but for the convenience of visiting tourists many villagers are providing facilities like home stays and these hosts are being professionally trained in the technique of running a home stay the locals have now started the cultivation of dragon fruit and i am sure that it will soon become a major source of livelihood for the people there friends for our nation and the constituent states as well as for the tourism industry this statue of unity can be a subject of research we are all witness to the fact that how within a year a place developed as a world famous tourism destination people arrive there from the country and abroad and one after the other ancillary services like transport lodging guides and eco friendly services are getting inducted by themselves a large economy is developing and people are generating facilities as per the requirement of the tourists the government is also playing its role friends which indian will not be imbued with pride for the fact that recently time magazine has included the statue of unity in its list of 100 important tourist destinations around the world of course i hope that all of you will devote some of your precious time to visit the statue of unity but my appeal is that every indian who takes out time to travel must visit at least 15 tourist destinations of india with family and experience a night stay at whichever place you go to this still remains my appeal friends as you know that

bharat shrestha bharat and so not just our body but our mind and value system get integrated with ushering unity in india to take india to loftier heights and so in whichever city you reside you can find out about the run for unity schedule a portal namely runforunity gov in has also been launched for dissemination of information about this event in this portal information has been provided about the venues where run for unity is to be organized across the country i hope you will all run on october 31st not only for the unity of india but also for your physical fitness my dear countrymen sardar patel integrated the nation with the thread of unison this mantra of unity is like a sacrament in our life and in a country like ours filled with diversities we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unison on all paths at every bend and at every pit stop my dear countrymen our nation has always been very proactive and alert in strengthening unity and communal harmony in the country if we look around us we will find many examples of individuals who have been working ceaselessly to foster communal harmony but sometimes it so happens that the efforts of the society and its contribution get wiped from our collective memory friends i remember when the allahabad high court gave its verdict on ram janmabhoomi in september 2010 you could jog your memory a bit and reflect about the atmosphere then various kinds of people took to the arena various interest groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation in their own way the kind of language that was spoken in order to generate tension in the atmosphere there was also an attempt to instill shrillness in the tone of different speakers some of the loudmouths and the braggarts had the sole intention of hogging the spotlight at that time and we all know what kind of irresponsible talk was floating around but this scenario had continued for five days or seven days or ten days but the delivery of the court s decision generated a pleasant and surprising change of mood in the country on the one hand the machinations went on to generate tension for week or two but when the decision was taken on ram janmabhoomi the government political parties social organizations civil society representatives of all sects and saints gave restrained and balanced statements there were attempts to reduce the tension in the sociopolitical environment but i remember that day vividly and whenever i do that i get happy that the dignity of the judiciary was very proudly honoured and no allowance for any heated discourse or tension was made anywhere these incidents should always be remembered as they impart us a lot of strength that day that moment instills in us all a sense of duty it is an example of how the voice of unison can bestow strength upon our country my dear countrymen on 31st october on the same day the former prime minister of our country smt indira ji was assasinated it was a traumatic moment for our country today i pay homage to her too my dear countrymen today if one story that rings from home to home and rings far and wide is heard from north to south east to west and from every corner of india then that is the story of cleanliness and sanitation every person every family every village wants to narrate their pleasant experiences in relation to the cleanliness mission because behind this effort of cleanliness is the effort of 125 crore indians the outcome also belongs to 125 crore indians but therein lies a pleasant and interesting experience too i heard it and i think i will share it with you too just imagine the highest battlefield in the world where the temperature drops from zero to 50 60 degrees minus oxygen in the air is also at a miniscule level living in the midst of such adverse conditions and challenges is not less than any display of valour in such a difficult situation our brave heart soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country but are also running a swacch siachen campaign in that arena on behalf of our countrymen i commend the indian army for this amazing commitment i also express my gratitude it is so cold there that its near impossible for anything to decompose in such a situation the segregation and management of garbage is a very important task in itself in this scenario to remove 130 tons and more of garbage from the glacier and its surrounding area s fragile eco system is a great service it is an eco system which is home to rare species like the snow leopard and rare animals like ibex and brown bears we all know that siachen as a glacier is a source of rivers and clean water therefore running a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water for those who live in low lying areas and also use the water of rivers like nubra and shyok my dear countrymen festivals are occasions that awaken a new consciousness in our lives and especially during diwali it is customary in every family to buy something new get something from the market in smaller or larger quantity i had once said that we should try to buy local products there is no need to go to the tehsil if our need is met in our village if it is found in tehsil then there is no need to go to the district the more we try to buy our local things the gandhi 150 will become a great event in itself and i keep insisting that we must buy some handloom products made by our weavers our khadi artisans even during this diwali you must have bought quite a few or a lot of things before diwali but there are many people who think that if they go shopping after diwali then may be they could get a good bargain so there will be many people who still have their shopping left hence along with the best of wishes on deepawali i would urge you to come forward and become a patron of local things and buy local and witness for ourselves how we can play an important role in making mahatma gandhi s dream come alive i once again wish you all the very best on this auspicious festival of diwali in diwali we burst fire crackers of all kinds but sometimes fire is caused due to carelessness an injury can also occur i urge all of you to take utmost care of yourself and also celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm i extend many felicitations to you thank you very much pm narendramodi begins today s mannkibaat by conveying diwali greetings today diwali has become a global festival says pm narendramodi in mannkibaat may our festivals bring more tourists to india mannkibaat during the last mannkibaat i had spoken about bharatkilaxmi and the response has been excellent the world bows to shri guru nanak dev ji mannkibaat from shri guru nanak dev ji we learn the importance of service mannkibaat the udasis of shri guru nanak dev ji took him to several parts of india and the world everyone was positively influenced by his thoughts mannkibaat let us pledge to realise the ideals of shri guru nanak dev ji mannkibaat paying tributes to sardar patel the stalwart who unified india mannkibaat sardar patel was a person of detail he was an excellent organiser mannkibaat an interesting anecdote about the meticulous planning of sardar patel mannkibaat we remember the efforts of sardar patel towards articulating and strengthening fundamental rights in our constitution mannkibaat we all know about sardar patel s efforts towards unifying some of the bigger places such as hyderabad and junagadh but do you know such was the man that he also focused on smaller places like lakshadweep mannkibaat the statue of unity completes a year mannkibaat will you take part in this year s run for unity mannkibaat let us always promote the spirit of unity as sardar patel would have desired mannkibaat pm narendramodi says why he vividly remembers the day allahabad hc delivered the ram janmabhoomi verdict thanks to the people of india social organisations saints seers and leaders of all faiths it became a day that furthered unity and the judiciary was also respected swachhata in siachen mannkibaat ,namaskar on the pious festival of deepawali greetings to all of you we are familiar with the lines of the shlok shubham karoti kalyanam aarogyam dhansampadaa shatrubudhdhi vinashaay deepajyoti namostute what a fine purposeful message
28-Aug-16,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on August 28, 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi commemorated the birth anniversary of hockey legend Dhyan Chand, celebrated as National Sports Day, highlighting the importance of sports in India.

He emphasized the significance of teachers in society and conveyed his greetings for Teachers' Day, emphasizing the contributions of Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan. He encouraged the celebration of Ganesh Utsav and the promotion of eco-friendly idols.

Modi praised the unity of political parties in passing the GST Act and expressed national solidarity with Kashmir, emphasizing that the loss of life in the region affects the entire nation.",28-aug-2016 my dear countrymen namaskar tomorrow 29th august is the birth anniversary of hockey wizard dhyan chand this occasion is celebrated as national sports day throughout the country i offer my tributes to dhyan chand ji and wish to remind you all about his invaluable contribution he played a pivotal role in helping india win hockey gold medals in olympic games of 1928 1932 and 1936 all of us cricket lovers know bradman s name very well he had complimented dhyan chand ji by saying that he scores goals like runs dhyan chand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and nationalism during a match in kolkata one player from the opposite team hit him on the head with the hockey stick at that point only 10 minutes were left in the game and dhyan chand ji scored three goals in just those ten minutes and said i avenged the hit by scoring goals dear countrymen as the time of mann ki baat draws near a very large number of suggestions are received on mygov or narendramodiapp these are on diverse topics but i saw that this time in most of these suggestions people had asked me to say something about the rio olympics i find it a very positive sign that our common people have such attachment and awareness about rio olympics and they are insisting that the prime minister of the country says something on this matter it shows that besides cricket our people have so much involvement in and awareness and knowledge about other sports and games also for me even reading these messages proved to be a source of inspiration one shri ajit singh ji has written on narendramodiapp please this time in mann ki baat do talk about the education of our daughters our betis and their participation in sports because they have brought laurels for the country by winning medals at the rio olympics one shri sachin has written to urge that in mann ki baat this time a mention may please be made about sindhu saakshi and deepa karmakar whatever medals we got have been earned by our daughters these betis have once again proved that they are second to none in any respect one of these daughters is from north india while there is one who belongs to south india and then there is one from the eastern part all in all they represent all corners of our country it seems that our daughters in the whole of india have decided to take up the responsibility of bringing glory to the nation shikhar thakur has written on mygov that we could have performed better at the olympics he has written respected modi sir first of all congratulations on our winning two medals at rio however i want to draw your attention to the question was our performance really good and the answer is no we have to go a long way in the field of sports our parents even today insist on focusing on studies and academics sports are considered a waste of time in our society we need to change this mindset society needs motivation for this and no one can do this better than you similarly one shri satya prakash mehra ji has written on narednramodiapp in mann ki baat there is a need to focus on extra curricular activities especially on encouraging children and youth to play thousands of people have expressed similar sentiments there is no denying the fact that we could not perform up to the expectations some of our players could not even touch during these games their own performance level which they had achieved during the domestic events in india in the medals chart our tally was only two medals however it is also a fact that if we look closely we shall find that despite missing medals indian players gave a very good account of themselves for the first time in some of the events see our abhinav bindra very narrowly missed the medal and got fourth place in shooting dipa karmakar produced a superb performance in gymnastics although she remained at the fourth place and missed a bronze by a very narrow margin but how can we forget that she is india s first daughter to qualify in gymnastics for the olympics and also to reach the final round the pair of sania mirza and rohan bopanna met almost a similar fate in tennis our athletes this time gave a creditable performance after 32 years of p t usha s feat lalita babar qualified for the finals in track and field our women s hockey team qualified for the olympic games after a space of 36 long years men s hockey team reached knock out stage after 36 years our team is quite strong and the interesting part is that gold medalist argentina lost just one match in the entire tournament and the team which defeated them was india thus the future surely seems bright for us vikas krishna yadav reached the quarter finals in boxing but could not win bronze many players like aditi ashok dattu bhokanal atanu das gave a very good performance but my dear countrymen we do have to go a long way and if we stick to the same routine we may perhaps keep facing the same disappointment i have announced setting up of a committee the government of india will make an in depth in house analysis and will study the practices being followed around the world we shall prepare a roadmap on how we can do better we have to prepare a far reaching plan keeping in view the olympics in 2020 2024 2028 i urge the state governments also to set up similar committees to find out as to what we can do in sports what can each state do the states can take up one or two sports of their choice and display their strength i urge our sports associations also to do objective and impartial brainstorming on this and i also request all citizens of the country who have interest in this matter to mail their suggestions on narendramodiapp they may write to the government associations may discuss these issues and submit their memoranda to the government state governments too should deliberate on this matter and provide their suggestions but we must prepare ourselves fully and thoroughly and i am confident that we the nation of 125 crore people comprising 65 percent youth population can reach an exalted status in the world of sports too we have to move ahead with this resolve my dear countrymen 5th september is teachers day for many years i have been spending a lot of time with students on teachers day and that too as a student myself i used to learn quite a lot from those young children for me 5th september was teachers day as well as an education day but this time i have to leave for g 20 summit and so felt in my heart that i should express my feelings in this regard in mann ki baat today in our life a teacher holds the same place which a mother does we have also seen such teachers who care more for their pupils than for themselves they devote their lives for their disciples their students these days after rio olympics pulela gopi chand ji is being talked about everywhere he is a player first but he has set up a glorious example of what a good coach that is a teacher should be i see gopi chand ji today as an excellent teacher besides being a very accomplished player and on teachers day i salute pulela gopi chand ji for his hard work his dedication towards sports and his manner of finding happiness in the success of his disciples we always feel the contribution of our teachers in our lives 5th september happens to be the birthday of india s former president dr sarvapalli radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates this as teachers day whatever post he held in his life he always tried to live like a teacher an educator not only this he always said that a good teacher can only be one who keeps the student within always alive dr radhakrishnan ji showed this by living as a teacher and by keeping alive the student within him despite holding the highest office of the president some times when i think of it i remember so many incidents related with my teachers because they were our heroes in our small village however i can happily say that even now i receive a hand written letter every month from one of my teachers who has turned 90 now in this letter he mentions books read by him during that month along with quotations he also gives his comments on what he deems correct or otherwise in whatever i have done during the month it is as if he is even now teaching me in the class room in a way he is conducting a correspondence course for me even today and about his handwriting even at the age of 90 i marvel that he writes so beautifully whereas my own handwriting is very poor that is why whenever i look at somebody s good handwriting i have a great respect for it you may also be having similar experience if you tell the world about whatever good has happened in your life because of your teachers people s attitude towards teachers would change it will be a matter of pride and it is our duty to enhance the honour of our teachers in the society if you have a photograph with your teacher or an incident connected with your teacher or an inspirational thing associated with your teacher please do share the same on narendramodiapp looking at the contribution of teachers in the country from the point of view of students is also immensely valuable in itself my dear countrymen ganesh utsav is drawing near ganesh ji removes all obstacles and let us all wish that our country our society our families and each one of us may lead a life free of obstacles but when we mention ganesh utsav it is natural to remember lokmanya tilak ji the tradition of public celebration of ganesh utsav is lokmanya tilak s gift to us by publicly celebrating ganesh utsav he turned this religious occasion into a festival of national awakening and social refinement these ganesh festivities included holding wide ranging discussions on the issues that touched our lives and society and comprised such programmes which provided a new vigour and vitality to our social fabric also his mantra swaraj that is freedom is my birthright should have the main focus thereby strengthening the freedom movement now not in maharashtra alone but in each corner of india ganesh utsav is celebrated publicly young people make elaborate preparations they are full of vigour some people even now try to follow the path shown by lokmanya tilak ji they organise debates on topics of public interest and hold essay competitions and rangoli competitions tableus depict the issues of social concern in a very artistic manner in a way a mass campaign of public education gets underway through these ganesh festivities lokmanya tilak ji gave us the inspirational mantra swaraj that is freedom is our birthright but now we live in independent india so do we through these public ganesh festivals move now to suraaj that is good governance by proclaiming suraaj is my birthright good governance suraaj should be our priority can we not recite this mantra and give a message for it in the public ganesh festival celebrations come on i invite you all it is true that festivals express the vitality of a society festivals infuse new life into individuals as well as the society life seems to be impossible without festivals but these have to be moulded according to the needs of the changing times i have seen that this time many people have written to me mentioning ganeshotsav and durga puja they are worried about environment one shri shankar narayan prashant has strongly urged modi ji kindly tell the people through your mann ki baat that they should not use ganesh idols made of plaster of paris why should we not use ganeshji idols made of the clay from the village pond pop idols are not environment friendly he has expressed a great pain others have also i request you all as to why should we not use clay in making ganesh and durga idols and revert to our old tradition this will help in environment preservation prevent pollution of our rivers and ponds and also provide protection to small creatures living in water this is also the service of god ganesh ji removes obstacles so we should not make such ganeshji idols which create problems i do not know how you will take my suggestions but it is not just me but many other people saying the same thing i have heard about many such people including pune based sculptor shri abhijit dhondphale kolhapur institutions nisarg mitra and vigyan prabodhini nisarg katta in vidarbh gyan prabodhini of pune and girgaoncha raja of mumbai many such institutions work hard to promote ganesh idols made from clay and they also propagate it eco friendly ganeshotsav is also social service there is still time left before the start of durga pooja festivities if we resolve now our efforts will lead to employment generation for those families which traditionally used to make clay idols in the past also the clay will go back and get dissolved in the pond or the river and will thus help in protecting the environment i offer my best wishes to you all for ganesh chaturthi my dear countrymen bharat ratna mother teresa will be canonized that is accorded sainthood on 4th september mother teresa devoted her entire life to the service of the poor in india though she was born in albania and her mother tongue was not english yet she transformed her life and did everything to be able to serve the poor when mother teresa who served the poor in india all through her life is accorded sainthood it is quite natural for we indians to feel proud indian government will send an official delegation under the leadership of our external affairs minister sushma swaraj to represent 125 crore indians at the canonization ceremony to be held on 4th september we keep learning something or the other from great men and women saints sages holy people we shall continue to receive something learn something from them and keep on doing some good things my dear countrymen when development becomes a mass movement a big transformation takes place peoples power is in a way considered to be a divine incarnation government of india has made a successful effort to clean the ganga and involve the people for this project with the cooperation of five state governments pradhans of villages situated on the banks of the river ganga were invited to allahabad on the 20th of this month they included men as well as women they came to allahabad and took an oath before mother ganga that they will make all out efforts to immediately stop the practice of open defecation in their villages situated on the banks of ganga start a campaign of building toilets and also that these villages will make their full contribution in cleaning up ganga and will ensure that ganga is not polluted now i congratulate all the pradhans who had assembled in allahabad with this resolve from different states they had come from uttrakhand from uttar pradesh from bihar from jharkhand and from west bengal i also congratulate all those ministries of the government of india and also those ministers who turned this vision into reality i also want to thank the chief ministers of these five states for taking the vital step in the direction of making ganga clean by involving people s power my dear countrymen certain things touch me very deeply and my heart bows in respect to those who visualize such heartwarming initiatives in kabirdham district of chhatisgarh more than 1 25 lakh students from about 1700 schools collectively wrote letters to their parents some students wrote in english some wrote in hindi and some in chhatisgarhi to their parents telling them that there should be toilets in their houses they demanded building toilets some students even wrote that they would rather go without celebrating birthday but the toilet must be constructed students of age between seven to seventeen took up this task and this had such an impact such an emotional impact that while the students were going to school the next day their parents handed over reply letters to them addressed to the teacher in which they promised to build toilets by a certain date positively my compliments to those who visualized this idea compliments to these students and special compliments to those parents who took their childrens letters so seriously and also took a decision to construct a toilet this is what inspires us in koppal district of karnataka a sixteen year old girl mallamma started a satyagrah against her own family she launched the satyagrah and stopped eating and she did that not to ask something for herself not to demand good clothes or have sweets this daughter mallamma was adamant to have a toilet built in her house but the family was not in a good position economically the daughter stuck to her demand and was not prepared to end her satyagrah the village pradhan mohammad shafi came to know about this he was told that mallamma had protested to press for her demand for getting a toilet built in her house now look at the gesture of village pradhan mohammad shafi he arranged eighteen thousand rupees and got a toilet built within a week just see the power and strength in mallamma s protest and also consider the grand gesture of a village pradhan like mohammad shafi look how the solutions to problems are found this is the power of the people my dear countrymen swachha bharat has become the dream of each indian some indians have made it their resolve some indians have made it their aim and purpose but each one is connected to it in one or the other way and everyone is making a contribution daily we hear about the various innovative efforts in this direction acting on one such idea the government of india has called upon the people to make short films of 2 to 3 minutes duration on swachhta that is cleanliness and send these to the government you can find details of this plan on website a competition will be held and the winners will be awarded prizes on gandhi jayanti day on 2nd october i request tv channels also to invite such films and hold a competition creativity can give a new strength to swachhata abhiyan or cleanliness campaign new slogans will emerge newer methods will come to knowledge a new inspiration will be generated and all this will happen with the great support of the people lesser known artists could be taken and it is not necessary to have a big studio and a big camera you can even shoot a film these days using your mobile phone camera i call upon you all to come forward and participate my dear countrymen india has always tried its best to have close cordial and vibrant relations with its neighbours a very important event took place recently the honourable president of india shri pranab mukherjee inaugurated a new radio channel named akashvani maitree channel at kolkata now some people may wonder whether honourable president should inaugurate a radio channel but this is no ordinary radio channel it is a very big and very important step we have bangladesh as our neighbour we know that both bangladesh and west bengal continue to have a common cultural heritage so akashvani maitree on this side and bangladesh betaar on that side will mutually share the content and bengali speaking people on both sides will enjoy the programmes of akashvani that is all india radio this people to people contact is a big contribution of akashvani the president launched this radio channel i extend my thanks to bangladesh also for collaborating with us in this initiative i congratulate the friends in all india radio too for making their contribution in our foreign policy also my dear countrymen although you have entrusted me with the responsibilities of prime minister but i also am a human being just like you at times sensitive events touch me a little too deeply such sentimental incidents generate new energy give new inspiration and this is what motivates us indians to do some remarkable things i received a letter recently which touched my heart a motherly lady of about 84 years of age who is a retired teacher wrote that letter to me if she had not forbidden me from revealing her name i from the core of my heart wanted to announce her name while talking to you she wrote in her letter that after my appeal to the people to forego their cooking gas subsidy she had given up her subsidy and then she even forgot about it however a few days ago a person on my behalf went to her and delivered a letter in which she was thanked for her giving up the subsidy and she has said that a letter from the prime minister was no less than a padma shree honour for her dear countrymen you may be knowing that i have tried to send a letter to be delivered personally through my representatives to all those who surrendered their cooking gas subsidy on my appeal my effort is to send letters to more than one crore people under this plan my letter had reached this mother who wrote back to me saying that i was doing a good work under the campaign of providing relief to those poor ladies who are getting freedom from the smoke of a chulha i am a retired teacher and will cross the age of 90 years within a few years and i am sending you a donation of fifty thousand rupees which you can use in this mission of providing relief from the chulha smoke to the poor women you may well imagine the missionary spirit of this retired teacher living on pension and donating an amount of fifty thousand rupees for the sake of provision of gas connection to the other poor mothers and sisters in order to save them from the ill effects of chulha smoke it is not a question of 50 thousand rupees but the basic question is of the empathy in this old lady and it is because of the blessings of this lady and of crores of our other mothers and sisters which strengthens my confidence in the future of the country and she did not write to me this letter as a prime minister but she straightforwardly wrote modi bhaiya i salute this wonderful mother and i also salute crores of similar mothers in india who keep doing something or the other all the time for the benefit of others despite facing many difficulties themselves my dear countrymen we were struggling with drought like conditions last year but this august we have been facing the fury of floods all through in some parts of the country there have been repetitive floods state governments union government local self government bodies social organisations and the citizens did whatever best could be done yet even amidst the reports of these floods some such events happened which should be remembered which show the power of unity and how big results can be achieved by working together the month of august this year has become memorable in august 2016 about 90 political parties in the country many of these parties in the parliament which were staunch opponents of each other and which do not miss the slightest opportunity against each other all these parties got united and passed the gst act the credit for this goes to all the parties and this is an example which shows that great tasks can be accomplished by working in unison to move ahead similarly about the incidents that took place in kashmir and all that happened in kashmir all political parties in the country collectively expressed their views in one voice a massage was sent to the whole world a massage also went to the separatist forces and our sympathy was expressed towards the people of kashmir whatever interaction with whomsoever i had on kashmir resounded with these views quite prominently and if i may try to summarise these views and comments the gist and essence were unity and affection these two were the fundamental points and we all are of the view and this is the view of all 125 crore indians right from the village pradhan to the prime minister that every loss of life in kashmir whether it is of a young man or of a security personnel it is our own loss a loss of our people a loss for the nation those trying to disturb peace in kashmir by putting small children in the front and hiding behind them will have to be answerable to these very innocent children some day my dear countrymen ours is a vast nation full of diversities to keep this country of manifold diversities united we all as citizens as society and as the government have a responsibility to encourage things which strengthen our national unity and highlight these with full vigour only then we can make our country s future bright and of course this will be achieved i have full faith in the power of my 125 crore countrymen that is all for today many many thanks ,125 crore indians celebrate the birth anniversary of hockey wizard dhyan chand and wish to remind you all about his invaluable contribution he played a pivotal role in helping india win hockey gold medals in olympic games of 1928 1932 and 1936
28-Aug-22,"In his August 2022 'Mann Ki Baat' address, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the widespread enthusiasm and creativity across India during the Amrit Mahotsav, celebrating 75 years of independence. He commended the nation's unity and patriotism demonstrated through various tricolor-themed events and projects. The Prime Minister also urged citizens to watch the 'Swaraj' Doordarshan serial to learn about unsung heroes of the freedom movement and embrace their inspirational stories. He emphasized the significance of water conservation and the ongoing Amrit Sarovar campaign. Modi shared various examples of Amrit Sarovar initiatives contributing to water conservation, agriculture, and the environment. The address also discussed efforts to combat malnutrition during Poshan Maah in September and encouraged the consumption of millets. The International Year of Millets in 2023 was highlighted as an opportunity to promote these nutritious grains globally. Modi recognized the transformative power of digital connectivity in remote areas, sharing stories of digital entrepreneurs who have thrived through various government initiatives. The message concluded by underlining the importance of cultural traditions, local resource utilization, and organic farming in hilly regions, particularly in Spiti and Uttarakhand.",28-aug-2022 my dear countrymen namaskar in this month of august all your letters messages and cards have soaked my office in the hues of the tricolor i have hardly come across any letter which does not carry the tricolor or does not talk about the tricolor and freedom children and young friends have sent beautiful pictures and artwork on the amrit mahotsav in this month of independence in our entire country in every city every village the nectar of amrit mahotsav is flowing on this special occasion of amrit mahotsav and independence day we have seen the collective might of the country there has been a sense of realisation such a big country so many diversities but when it came to hoisting the tricolor everyone seemed to flow in the same spirit people themselves came forward becoming the vanguard of the pride of the tricolor we had also seen the spirit of the country in the cleanliness campaign and the vaccination campaign we are getting to witness the same spirit of patriotism again in the amrit mahotsav our soldiers hoisted the tricolor on the peaks of high mountains on the borders of the country and in the middle of the sea people also came up with different innovative ideas for the tricolor campaign such as young friend krishnil anil ji anil ji is a puzzle artist and has created beautiful tricolor mosaic art in record time in kolar karnataka people presented a unique sight by holding the tricolor that was 630 feet long and 205 feet wide in assam government employees created a 20 feet tricolor with their own hands to hoist at the dighalipukhuri war memorial similarly people in indore made the map of india through a human chain in chandigarh the youth made a giant human tricolor both these efforts have also been recorded in the guinness records in the midst of all this a great inspirational example was also seen at the gangot panchayat of himachal pradesh here the children of migrant laborers were included as chief guests in the independence day programme of the panchayat friends these colors of the amrit mahotsav were seen not only in india but also in other countries of the world local singers living in botswana sang 75 patriotic songs to celebrate 75 years of india s independence what is more special in this is that these 75 songs were sung in languages like hindi punjabi gujarati bangla assamese tamil telugu kannada and sanskrit similarly in namibia a special stamp has been released on the indo namibian cultural traditional relations friends i want to share with you another thing of joy just a few days ago i got an opportunity to attend a program of ministry of information and broadcasting government of india there they had organised the screening of swaraj the doordarshan serial i got an opportunity to attend its premiere this is a great initiative to acquaint the younger generation of the country with the efforts of unsung heroes and heroines who took part in the freedom movement it is telecast every sunday at 9 pm on doordarshan and i was told that is going to continue for 75 weeks i urge you to take time out to watch it yourself and do show it to the children of the house and people from schools colleges can also record it and compose a special program when the school college opens on monday so that a new awakening will arise in our country about these great heroes of the birth of freedom the azadi ka amrit mahotsav will continue till next year i e august 2023 for the country for the freedom fighters the writings and events that we have been organising we have to carry them forward my dear countrymen the knowledge of our forefathers the farsightedness of our ancestors and the ekatmachintan integral self realisation is so significant even today when we go deep into it we are filled with wonder our thousands of years old rigveda in rigveda it is said oman mapo manushi amritkam dhaat tokay tanayaaya shyamyo yooyam hisatha bhishjo matritama vishwasya sthatu jagato janitri meaning o water you are the best friend of humanity you are the giver of life food is produced from you and from you is the well being of our children you are the protector of us and keep us away from all evils you are the best medicine and you are the sustainer of this universe think about it the importance of water and water conservation has been explained in our culture thousands of years ago when we see this knowledge in today s context we are thrilled but when the nation accepts this knowledge as its strength then their power increases manifold you will remember in mann ki baat i had talked about amrit sarovar four months ago after that the local administration got active in different districts voluntary organizations came together and local people connected and lo behold the construction of amrit sarovars has become a mass movement when there is a deep feeling to do something for the country realize one s duties concern for the coming generations then the capabilities also get added up and the resolve becomes noble i have come to know of a brilliant effort from warangal in telangana a new gram panchayat has been formed here named mangtya valya thanda this village is close to the forest area there was a place near the village where a lot of water used to accumulate during monsoon on the initiative of the villagers this place is now being developed under the amrit sarovar campaign this time due to the rains during the monsoon this lake has been filled to the brim with water i also want to tell you about the amrit sarovar built in mocha gram panchayat in mandla madhya pradesh this amrit sarovar is built near the kanha national park and has further enhanced the beauty of this area the newly constructed shaheed bhagat singh amrit sarovar in lalitpur uttar pradesh is also drawing a lot of people this lake built in the niwari gram panchayat is spread over 4 acres the tree plantation on the shoreline of the lake is enhancing its beauty people are also coming from far and wide to see the 35 feet high tricolor near the lake this campaign of amrit sarovars is going on in full swing in karnataka as well here in the village bilkerur of bagalkot district people have built a very beautiful amrit sarovar in fact in this area people had a lot of problems because of the water flowing down from the mountain farmers and their crops also suffered losses to make the amrit sarovar the people of the village channelized all the water and brought it aside this also solved the problem of floods in the area the amrit sarovar abhiyan not only solves many of our problems today it is equally necessary for our coming generations under this campaign at many places old water bodies are also being rejuvenated amrit sarovars are being used for quenching the thirst of animals as well as for farming due to these ponds the ground water table of the surrounding areas has risen at the same time greenery is also increasing around them not only this people at many places are also engaged in preparations for fish farming in amrit sarovars i urge all of you especially my young friends to actively participate in the amrit sarovar campaign and lend full strength to these efforts of water conservation water storage and take them forward my dear countrymen an interesting project is being run in bongai village of assam project sampoorna the purpose of this project is to fight against malnutrition and the method too is very unique under this the mother of a healthy child from an anganwadi center meets the mother of a malnourished child every week and discusses all the nutrition related information that is one mother becomes a friend of another mother helps her and teaches her with the help of this project in this region in one year malnutrition has been eradicated in more than 90 percent children can you imagine whether song and music and bhajans can also be used to remove malnutrition it was successfully used in mera bachha campaign the mera bachha abhiyan in datia district of madhya pradesh under this bhajan kirtans were organized in the district in which teachers as nutrition gurus were called a matka program was also held in which women bring a handful of grains to the anganwadi center and with this grain a balbhoj is organized on saturdays besides this increase in the attendance of children in anganwadi centers malnutrition has also shown a dip a unique campaign is also going on in jharkhand to increase awareness about malnutrition a snake ladder game has been prepared in giridih jharkhand through play children learn about good and bad habits friends i am telling you about so many innovative experiments related to malnutrition because all of us also have to join this campaign in the coming month the month of september is dedicated to festivals as well as a big campaign related to nutrition we celebrate the poshan maah every year from the 1st to the 30th of september many creative and diverse efforts are being made all over the country against malnutrition better use of technology and also public participation has become an important part of the nutrition campaign from providing mobile devices to millions of anganwadi workers in the country a poshan tracker has also been launched to monitor the accessibility of anganwadi services in all the aspirational districts and the states of the north east 14 to 18 year old daughters have also been brought under the purview of the poshan abhiyaan the solution to the malady of malnutrition is not limited just to these steps in this fight many other initiatives also play an important role for example take the jal jeevan mission this mission is also going to have a huge impact in making india malnutrition free efforts for social awareness play an important role in tackling the challenges of malnutrition i would urge all of you in the coming nutrition month to take part in the efforts to eradicate malnutrition my dear countrymen sridevi varadarajan ji from chennai has sent me a reminder she has written something like this on mygov there are less than 5 months left for the new year to come and we all know that the ensuing new year will be celebrated as the international year of millets she has also sent me a millet map of the country she s also asked if you could discuss this in the upcoming episode of mann ki baat it gives me immense happiness to see this kind of spirit in my countrymen you will remember that the united nations has passed a resolution declaring the year 2023 as the international year of millets you will also be very happy to know that this proposal of india had been accepted by more than 70 countries today around the world craze for these very coarse grains millets is rising friends when i talk about coarse grains i want to share one of my efforts with you today for the last some time when any foreign guests come to india when heads of state comes to india it is my endeavor to get dishes made from the millets of india that is our coarse grains in the banquets and the experience has been that these dignitaries have very much relished them and they also try to collect a lot of information about our coarse grains about millets millets coarse grains have been a part of our agriculture culture and civilization since ancient times millets are mentioned in our vedas and similarly they are also mentioned in purananuru and tolkappiyam if you go to any part of the country you will definitely find different types of millets in the food of the people there in millets too just like our culture a lot of diversity is found jowar bajra ragi sawan kangni cheena kodo kutki kuttu all these are just millets india is the largest producer of millets in the world hence the responsibility of making this initiative a success also rests on the shoulders of us indians together we all have to make it a mass movement and also increase the awareness of millets among the people of the country and friends you know very well millets are also beneficial for the farmers and especially the small farmers in fact the crop gets ready in a very short time and does not require much water either for our small farmers millets are especially beneficial millet hay is also considered the best fodder nowadays the young generation is much focused on healthy living and eating even if you look at it this way millets contain plenty of protein fiber and minerals many people even call it a superfood millets have many benefits not just one along with reducing obesity they also reduce the risk of diabetes hypertension and heart related diseases along with that they are also helpful in preventing stomach and liver ailments we referred to malnutrition just a while ago millets are also very beneficial in fighting malnutrition since they are packed with energy as well as protein today a lot is being done to promote millets in the country along with focusing on research and innovation related to this fpos are being encouraged so that production can be increased it is my request to my farmer brothers and sisters to adopt millets that is coarse grains more and more and benefit from it it feels good to see that many such start ups are emerging today which are working on millets some of these are making millet cookies while some are also making millet pancakes and dosa there are some who are making millet energy bars and millet breakfasts i wish all the very best to all the people working in this field in this festive season we also use millets in most of the dishes you must share the pictures of such delicacies made in your homes on social media so that it helps in increasing awareness among people about millets my dear countrymen just a few days ago i saw news from jorsing village in siang district of arunachal pradesh this news was about a change that the people of this village had been waiting for for many years in fact in jorsing village this month 4g internet services have started from independence day like earlier people used to be happy when electricity reached the village now in new india the same happiness is felt when 4g reaches there there has been a new sunrise in the form of 4g in the remote areas of arunachal and north east internet connectivity has brought a new dawn facilities which were once available only in big cities have been brought to every village through digital india for this reason new digital entrepreneurs are rising in the country setha singh rawat ji of ajmer district of rajasthan runs darzi online an e store you will wonder what is darzi online actually setha singh rawat used to do tailoring work before covid when covid came rawat ji did not take this challenge as a difficulty rather as an opportunity he joined the common service centre i e csc e store and started working online he saw that customers were placing orders for masks in large numbers he hired some women and started getting masks made after this he started his online store named darzi online in which he started selling stitched clothes of many other kinds today with the power of digital india the work of setha singh ji has increased so much that now he gets orders from all over the country he has given employment to hundreds of women here digital india has also turned om prakash singh ji of unnao up into a digital entrepreneur he has established more than one thousand broadband connections in his village om prakash ji has also built a free wifi zone around his common service centre which is helping the needy people a lot om prakash ji s work has increased so much that he has hired more than 20 people these people are providing broadband connection to the schools hospitals tehsil offices and anganwadi centers of the villages and are also getting employment from it like the common service center there are many such success stories are being seen on the government e market place i e gem portal friends i get many such messages from villages which share with me the changes brought about by the internet the internet has changed the way our young friends study and learn for example when gudiya singh of up came to her in laws house in amoiya village of unnao she was worried about her studies but bharatnet resolved her concern gudiya carried on her studies through the internet and also completed her graduation how many such lives in villages are getting new strength from the digital india campaign do write to me as much as you can about the digital entrepreneurs of the villages and also share their success stories on social media my dear countrymen sometime back i received a letter from ramesh ji a listener of mann ki baat from himachal pradesh ramesh ji has enumerated many specialities of the hills in his letter he wrote that the settlements on the mountains might be far apart but the hearts of the people are very close to each other indeed we can learn a lot from the lives of the people living in the hills the first lesson we get from the lifestyle and culture of the hills is that if we do not come under the pressure of circumstances we can easily overcome them and secondly how we can become self sufficient with local resources the first lesson that i mentioned a beautiful picture of it is being seen in the spiti region these days spiti is a tribal area here these days pea plucking goes on this is a laborious and difficult task on hill farms but here the women of the village gather and together pluck peas from each other s fields along with this task women also sing the local song chhapra majhi chhapra that is mutual cooperation here is also a part of folk tradition the best example of utilization of local resources is also found in spiti farmers who rear cows in spiti dry up the dung and fill it in sacks when winter comes these sacks are laid out in the sheds where the cows live which is called khud here during snowfall these sacks give protection to the cows from the cold after winters this cow dung is used as manure in the fields that is the animals protection using animal waste and also manure for the fields the cost of cultivation is also low and the yield in the fields is also high that is why this area these days is also becoming an inspiration for natural farming friends many such commendable efforts are also being seen in our other hill state uttarakhand many types of medicines and plants are found in uttarakhand which are very beneficial for our health one of them is the fruit bedu it is also known as himalayan fig in this fruit minerals and vitamins are found in abundance people consume it not only in the form of fruit but it is also used in the treatment of many diseases in view of these qualities of this fruit now the juice of bedu jams chutneys pickles and dry fruits prepared by drying them have been launched in the market with the initiative of the pithoragarh administration and the cooperation of the local people it has been successful in bringing bedu to the market in different forms bedu has also been launched in the online market by branding it as pahari fig due to this farmers have not only found a new source of income but the benefits of the medicinal properties of bedu have started reaching far and wide as well my dear countrymen in the beginning of mann ki baat today we referred to the azadi ka amrit mahotsav along with the great festival of independence day many more festivals are lined up in the coming days just a few days from now is the festival of ganesh chaturthi the festival of worship of

28-Feb-16,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on February 28, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed his support and encouragement to students appearing for exams. He emphasized the need for a positive mindset, setting achievable targets, and focusing on self-improvement rather than competing with others. The Prime Minister shared messages from inspirational figures like Sachin Tendulkar and chess champion Vishwanathan Anand, who encouraged students to stay calm and maintain a positive outlook. He also highlighted the importance of health, discipline, and good sleep for exam preparation. PM Modi stressed the significance of understanding exam questions and the benefits of a positive and relaxed environment. He also discussed the role of parents and teachers in supporting students and asked parents not to pressure their children. The Prime Minister recognized National Science Day and celebrated the recent discovery of gravitational waves by Indian scientists, affirming India's commitment to further scientific exploration. He informed the public that a Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) would be established in India. The address concluded with best wishes for both the upcoming Budget Day and the students' exams, emphasizing the nation's collective success.",28-feb-2016 my dear fellow citizens namaskar while listening to this month s mann ki baat my inner thoughts your mind must also be on your children s exams which begin soon some of them have their 10th and 12th board exams starting from the 1st of march that must be playing on your mind i wish to be a part of this journey along with you i am concerned about your children s exams as much as you are but i am not worried if we were to change the way we look at exams then we would be tension free when i shared my inner thoughts with you during last month s mann ki baat i had requested everybody to send their experiences and suggestions to me on narendra modi app it makes me immensely happy that teachers and students who have had successful careers as also parents and social thinkers have shared their experiences and suggestions with me there are two things that have moved me first those who have written to me have a good grip on the subject and second the sheer volume of the response to my request shows dealing with exams is an extremely important matter usually the issue of exams has largely remained confined to schools teachers students and their families but the way suggestions have come pouring in through my app it seems this should be a subject of constant discussion for the entire nation today during my mann ki baat i would like to share my inner thoughts on exams with parents students and teachers i will share some of the things that i have heard what i have read and what i have been told i will add my views on some exam related issues about which i feel strongly i am confident that students who will be appearing for exams will find what i have to say immensely useful to them that s how i feel about it my dear students before i begin why not let a well known world opener make the opening comments about the things and experiences that helped him achieve heights of success in his life that would definitely be useful for you he is someone the young generation is proud of and inspired by bharat ratna sachin tendulkar he has sent a message that i will read out to you namaskar i am sachin tendulkar speaking i know that the 10th board exams are going to commence in a few days from now many of you are going to be tense about them i have only one message for you all your parents your teachers your family members and your friends have a lot of expectations from you wherever you go you will be asked how are the preparations going how many marks are you likely to score i would like to say that you should set a target for yourself don t come under the pressure of someone else s expectations you should definitely work hard but set a realistic and achievable target for yourself and then try to achieve that target when i used to play cricket there were a lot of expectations from me as well i faced a lot of difficult moments in these last 24 years and many a times there were good moments too but people always had high expectations from me as time passed their expectations kept growing so it was necessary for me to find a solution to this that s when i decided that i would set expectations for myself and set my own targets if i set my own targets and i am able to achieve them then i am sure to do something good for my country and those were the targets that i would always try to achieve for myself my focus would be on the ball and slowly slowly targets were achieved on their own i would like to tell all of you that you must have a positive thinking positive results will follow so you must be positive and god will surely give you good results i am hopeful of that my best wishes to you all please go write your exams free from tension and get good results good luck friends you heard what tendulkar ji had to say don t buckle under the pressure of expectations it is you who have to shape your own future so set your own targets for yourselves keep an open mind think freely and assess your own abilities i am sure that what sachin ji has said will prove very helpful for you also why should there be rivalry why not healthy competition why do we waste our time competing with others why don t we compete with ourselves why don t we decide to break our own previous record if you were to do that none would be able to stop you from moving ahead when you break your own record you will not have to depend on others for happiness and satisfaction there will be a sense of inner satisfaction friends don t look at exams as a game of numbers how much did i score where did i score don t get trapped in this score keeping you should think of a greater purpose in life you should have a dream to realise and a goal that you are committed to exams are there to only gauge whether we are going the right way or not whether we are moving at the right speed or not so if our dreams are big and magnificent exams will become a joyful experience each exam will then become just one more step towards realizing that dream each success will turn into a key of realizing that goal so don t brood over what is going to happen in these exams this year have a large perspective and a goal and move ahead once you do that even if you achieve less than what you had expected you will not be disappointed rather it will give you the strength and confidence to try harder and better the next time thousands of people have used their mobile phones to post small messages on my app shrey gupta has stressed the point that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body only students should care for their health along with their studies so that they are able to write their exams well in good health and spirit on the last day before exams begin i would not really urge you to start doing push ups get down on the field or go for a 3 to 5 km walk but one thing is for sure especially during the days when examinations are held and that is your schedule matters in any case our daily schedule for all the 365 days in a year should be in line with achieving our dreams and goals i agree with the message posted by shri prabhakar reddy he has specially urged that one should go to sleep at a proper time and get up early in the morning to revise one s preparation one should arrive at the examination centre equipped with the admit card and other things well before time this is what prabhakar reddy has said something which i would have perhaps dared not to say because i am not very particular when it comes to sleeping my friends complain to me often that i sleep very little this is my shortcoming which i will try to overcome i do agree that a fixed time to go to sleep and a sound sleep are as important as other activities during the day this is possible i am fortunate that although i sleep very less i sleep very soundly and thus am able to manage with that little sleep but i would like to request you all to get proper sleep there are some who are in the habit of chatting over the phone for long hours before going to sleep and then they ponder over things they chatted about how can they get proper sleep when i talk of sleep please don t think i am asking you to sleep at the cost of your preparation for the exams at the time of exams you should get a good sleep so that you are free from stress and tension i am not saying that you should keep on sleeping it should not be that you score low marks and when your mother asks you why you have fared so badly you reply that it s because modiji had asked us to sleep so i dozed off i hope you will not do that i am sure you won t do anything like that discipline plays a major role in laying the foundation of success in our lives a strong foundation comes from discipline those who are un organized and undisciplined do those things in the evening that they should have done in the morning and then the work they had to do in the afternoon is done late at night they might feel that their job is somehow done but it results in so much wastage of energy and they are also saddled with unnecessary tension each moment you must have experienced that when one part of your body feels a little bit of pain the entire body doesn t feel well not just that our entire routine collapses so we should not view anything as trivial or unimportant please see to it that you don t compromise on the time you have set for things don t get into this mess do things the way you have planned them friends i have seen that there are two types of students there are students who focus their attention on what they have studied what they have learnt and what are their strong points the other kind are those students who keep worrying about which type of questions will be asked during exams whether they will be able to attempt answering them will the question paper be easy or difficult you must have noticed this too those who are tense and worry about what kind of questions will be asked end up having a negative impact on their results as well on the other hand students who have the confidence in what they know are able to tackle whatever comes in the question paper someone who can express this better than me is the person who is a master at checkmating others who has checkmated some of the greatest minds in the world he is chess champion vishwanathan anand and he will relate his experiences come why don t you learn how to checkmate in exams from him hello this is viswanathan anand first of all let me start off by wishing you all the best for your exams i will next talk a little bit about how i went to my exams and my experiences for that i found that exams are very much like problems you face later in life you need to be well rested get a good night s sleep you need to be on a full stomach you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is to stay calm it is very very similar to a game of chess when you play you don t know which pawn will appear just like in a class you don t know which question will appear in an exam so if you stay calm and you are well nourished and have slept well then you will find that your brain recalls the right answer at the right moment so stay calm it is very important not to put too much pressure on yourself don t keep your expectations too high just see it as a challenge do i remember what i was taught during the year can i solve these problems at the last minute just go over the most important things and the things you feel the topics you feel you don t remember very well you may also recall some incidents with the teacher or the students while you are writing an exam and this will help you recall a lot of subject matter if you revise the questions you find difficult you will find that they are fresh in your head and when you are writing the exam you will be able to deal with them much better so stay calm get a good night s sleep don t be over confident but don t be pessimistic either i have always found that these exams go much better than you fear before so stay confident and all the very best to you vishwanathan anand has really said something very important you must have also seen that when he plays in international tournaments he sits with such a healthy composure he is so focussed you must have seen his eyes don t wander off the chess board we have all heard of how arjun focussed his attention on the eye of the bird in the same way when we watch vishwanathan playing chess we see his eyes set on the target focussed on the game very attentively and that is a reflection of his inner tranquillity it is difficult to bring that inner peace within you just by someone merely asking you to do so but one should try why don t we try to do that in a light hearted manner if we were to keep smiling and laughing all through the exam days we would find inner peace if you don t speak to your friends walk alone and your face droops flipping through the pages of so many books at the last moment then you cannot have peace of mind laugh a lot along with your friends share jokes with them and just see how a calm atmosphere is created on its own just imagine yourself standing at the edge of a pond and you can see beautiful things at its bottom suddenly someone throws a stone into the water and there are ripples on the surface would you be able to see those beautiful things at the bottom like before if the water is still then no matter how deep it is everything at the bottom can be seen but if the water is agitated we can see nothing through it there is a lot within you the treasure as a result of the hard work of a whole year is filled inside you but if your mind is troubled you will not be able to discover that wealth if you have a peaceful mind then that treasure of yours is going to surface to the top and your exam will turn so very simple for you i would like to tell you a little thing about myself there are times when while listening to a lecture or trying to understand some aspect of governance about which i need to know more i have to concentrate on what is being said there are occasions when if i have to strain myself to concentrate i feel an inner stress building up then i realize that if i relax a bit i will feel better so here is a technique i have developed for myself i do deep breathing i breathe deeply three to five times not more than 50 seconds are spent on this but my mind is at rest and ready to be focused on matters at hand this is my experience and it might be of help to you as well rajat agarwal has told us something good he wrote on my app that we should spend half an hour every day with friends and family to feel relaxed we should chat with them this is something very important rajat ji has told us because what most of us do is that when we return after an exam we sit down to calculate what we did right and what we did wrong and if we have educated parents on top of it parents who are teachers themselves then they almost end up making us re write the entire paper they ask us what we wrote then start adding numbers to calculate how much we will score whether it will be 40 80 or 90 in this way your mind is totally consumed by what is already over and what do you do you also talk about the same thing with your friends over the phone what did you write what was your answer what did you do what do you think oh i got that one wrong i made a mistake there oh dear i knew the answer to that question but i couldn t remember it then we just get caught in all that friends please don t do this what happens in the examination hall is over and done there itself please chat about otherthings with your family talk of other topics refresh your mind with some light banter if you have gone on holidays with your parents then try and remember what you saw just come out of that exam mindset and spend half an hour with your parents what rajat ji has said is worth pondering over friends what can i tell you about peace of mind today before you go for your exams a message has come for you from someone who is essentially a teacher turned a value educator from giving interpretations of the ram charit manas in the present day context he is now involved with trying to spread its values in the country and to the whole world our revered murari bapu has sent some important tips for students he is a teacher and a thinker and for this reason what he has to say is a blend of both i am murari bapu speaking and i would like to tell my student friends not to carry any load on their minds during the exams decide upon clear thinking focus your mind wholly and go sit for the exam and whatever situation appears accept it my experience has been that we can remain happy by accepting the circumstances if you progress ahead in your exams fearlessly and happily you are sure to gain success and even if you are not successful you will not have any remorse nor will you be arrogant of your success i would like to conclude my message with a couplet it cannot be that one succeeds each time learn to also live with failures i felicitate this program mann ki baat presented by our honorable prime minister and my best wishes to all i am also grateful to our revered murari bapu for such a nice message friends i want to tell you about another thing today i see that in the experiences that people have shared with me they have spoken a lot about yoga and this is a matter of joy to me everybody i meet no matter for how short a time has something to say about yoga this is irrespective of whether the person is from another country or from india it s nice to hear that so much attraction has grown for yoga so much curiosity has developed for yoga just see how many people on my mobile app shri atanu mandal shri kunal gupta shrisushant kumar shri k g anand shriabhijeet kulkarni countless people have spoken about meditation and emphasized the beneficial effect of yoga friends if i ask you to start doing yoga from tomorrow morning then that would be unfair but those who are already practising yoga should not stop it during exam time if you do yoga keep doing it one thing is for sure whether it is your student days or any other phase of your life yoga is a major key to the development of your inner mind it is one of the simplest keys you must pay more attention to it yes if you have someone nearby who knows yoga and if you ask them during your exams and even if you have never done yoga before they will surely be able to tell you a few things to do in yoga that can very easily be done in a few minutes see if you can do it i have a lot of faith in yoga my dear young friends you are in a great hurry to enter the examination hall you are in a rush to quickly be seated in your place but why should you do these things in a hurry why can t you manage your time in such a way that even if you are held up in traffic you can still reach in time for your exam otherwise such hurdles can cause new stress one more thing with the limited time that we have we feel that going through the question paper with all the instructions is going to consume a lot of our time it is not like that dear friends you must read those instructions very carefully at most five minutes will be spent in that but it will not cause any loss in fact it will be quite profitable as things become clearer for you and later you won t have any regrets i have seen that when we get the question paper sometimes we find that it has been modelled on a new pattern but if we have read the instructions with due attention we can cope well with it we know ah yes that s the way we have to go about it i urge you all that even though it takes 5 minutes of your time you must go through the question paper carefully yash nagar writes on my mobile app that when he read a question paper for the first time he found it quite difficult but when he read the same paper with self confidence telling himself this is the only paper i have got and no other questions are going to be given i have to deal with just these many questions and so when i started thinking over them again he writes i was able to understand this paper quite easily when i read the questions the first time i felt i did not know the answers to them but when i read them again then i realised that the questions had been posed in a different way it is very important to understand the questions when we don t understand the questions that s when we sometimes find them difficult i forcefully support the point that yash nagar has made you must read the questions twice thrice four times over and try to match them with the things that you know and you will find that answering them becomes simple even before you have actually answered them it gives me great joy to share with you a message from bharat ratna c n r rao our most esteemed scientist he has emphasized the virtue of patience he has given a brief but very beautiful message to all students come let me tell you the message of shri rao this is c n r rao from bangalore i fully realise that the examinations cause anxiety that too competitive examinations do not worry do your best that s what i tell all my young friends at the same time remember that there are many opportunities in this country decide what you want to do in life and don t give it up you will succeed do not forget that you are a child of the universe you have a right to be here like the trees and the mountains all you need is doggedness dedication and tenacity with these qualities you will succeed in all examinations and all other endeavours i wish you luck in everything you want to do god bless see the style of talking that a scientist has what i take half an hour to say he says in a few minutes this is the strength of science and this is the strength that the mind of a scientist possesses i am grateful to shri raofor inspiring the children of the country the things that he mentioned about dedication determination diligence just keep at it my friends if you keep going then even fear will be afraid and a golden future awaits you for doing well ruchika dabas has sent a message on my app and shared her experience she writes that in her family during exams there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere this is true for the neighbouring families as well all contributed to a positive environment this is the way it should be sachin ji also talked of a positive approach a positive frame of mind we have to radiate a positive energy there are many things that inspire us and don t think that they inspire only students no matter at which point of life you are at fine examples and true stories give great inspiration great strength and pave a new path in times of trouble we have all read about the inventor of the electric bulb thomas alva edison but friends have you ever thought how many years he spent on his work how many times he met with failure how much time had to be devoted how much money was spent how much disappointment he must have faced when he met with failures but today that electric bulb illuminates our lives this is what is called the seeds of success inherent in failures who doesn t know of srinivas ramanujam one of the greatest names among modern indian mathematicians do you know that he had no formal education in mathematics yet he made a significant contribution to various topics like mathematical analysis number theory etc he had a life riddled with difficulties despite that he gave a lot to this world before passing away j k rowling is a fine example to show that success can come in anyone s life at any time the harry potter series is now popular worldwide but it was not like that from the start she had to face many difficulties many problems j k rowling has herself said that in times of trouble she would channelize all her energies into tasks that had real significance for her exams are not just for the students they also put the students families schools and teachers to test without the support system of parents and teachers the students would not stand a good chance if teachers parents and even senior students all combine to form a team a unit with a common thinking and in a planned way move forward then exams become a lot easier keshav vaishnav has written to me on my app complaining that parents should never put pressure on their children to score more marks they should only motivate them to prepare well for their exams they should think about the need for their child to stay relaxed vijay jindal writes that parents should not burden their children with their own expectations they should boost the confidence of their children as much as possible they should help maintain their children s faith in themselves and this is so right today i don t want to say much to the parents please don t create any pressure for your children if they are talking to any friend of theirs please don t stop them build a light hearted environment for them a positive environment and see for yourself be it your son or daughter what confidence they are infused with you will be able to see that confidence in your child yourself friends one thing is for sure and i want to say this especially to my young friends that our life has become very different from what it was for the previous generations every moment there is a new innovation a new technology we get to see new facets of science all the time its impact is overwhelming we all want to link ourselves to science and technology we also want to move ahead with the speed of science i say all this because friends today is national science day the festival of science in this country every year this day is observed on 28th february on 28th february 1928 sir c v raman had declared his discovery of the raman effect this was the discovery for which he received the nobel prize and so the nation celebrates this day as national science day curiosity is the mother of science each person should have a scientific thinking should be attracted to science each generation should lay stress on innovation and innovation is not possible without science and technology today on national science day we should resolve that innovation should gain importance science knowledge technology all these things should be a part of our journey to development this year the theme for national science day is make in india science and technology driven innovations i humbly pay my homage to sir c v raman and i appeal to you all to raise the level of your interest in science friends sometimes success comes very late and when it does come to us our way of looking at life changes completely as you have been kept very busy with the coming exams it might be possible that many news stories may not have registered on your minds but i want to repeat this for all fellow citizens as well you must have heard recently there has been a major and important discovery in the world of science scientists have labored hard generations of them have persevered and after nearly 100 years they have gained a huge success gravitational wave has been brought to light with the efforts of our scientists this is a success for science which was very difficult to achieve this discovery not only proves the theory of our greatest scientist of the previous century albert einstein but is also considered a great discovery for the world of physics it is going to be of use for the whole of humankind but being indians we should all feel happy that in the entire process of this discovery the sons of our country our worthy indian scientists were also a part of it i would like to extend my hearty congratulations to all those scientists our scientists will be involved in the future as well to take this discovery forward india will be a part of future international efforts my dear fellow citizens in the last few days we have taken an important decision to gain more success about this discovery the government of india has decided to install a laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory in short it is called ligo here in india this kind of a facility exists only in two places in the world india is going to be the third this process is going to gain fresh momentum and strength with india joining hands with others india with its reputed resources will surely be an active participant in this superior science discovery which is for the welfare of humankind i once again congratulate all scientists and send them my best wishes my dear fellow citizens i would like you to note down one number from tomorrow you can give a missed call on this number and listen to mann ki baat you can even listen to it in your mother tongue the number to give a missed call on is 81908 81908 i repeat 81908 81908 friends your exams begin from day after tomorrow i

successful careers as well parents and social thinkers have shared their experiences and suggestions with me"
28-Feb-21,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on 28th February 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the significance of the month of Magh in India, which is associated with water conservation and bathing in holy water bodies. He stressed the importance of conserving water and encouraged people to engage in efforts to clean and preserve water sources as World Water Day approaches. PM Modi shared inspiring stories of individuals and communities contributing to water conservation, such as efforts to rejuvenate wells, lakes, and ponds. He also emphasized the collective responsibility of conserving water and announced the upcoming Jal Shakti Abhiyan - CATCH THE RAIN initiative. The address paid tribute to Sant Ravidas on his birth anniversary, highlighting his teachings and the importance of self-reliance. The Prime Minister celebrated National Science Day and praised Indian scientists, emphasizing the need for promoting Indian scientific achievements. He shared stories of innovation and self-reliance across various sectors, from agriculture to technology. The address also showcased the successful efforts to increase waterfowl populations in Kaziranga National Park and the unique role played by temples in Assam in preserving nature. Lastly, PM Modi encouraged youth to prepare for exams with a positive mindset and announced the upcoming 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' event, inviting students, parents, and teachers to participate. He wished everyone well for the upcoming festivals and urged continued adherence to COVID-19 guidelines.",28-feb-2021 my dear countrymen namaskar yesterday was the festival of magh poornima the month of magh is regarded related especially to rivers lakes and water sources it has been mentioned in our scriptures maghe nimagnaaha salile sushite vimuktapaapaaha tridivam prayaanti meaning in the month of magh a bath in any holy water body is considered sacred in every society of the world invariably there is one tradition or the other with respect to a river many civilizations have evolved along the banks of rivers since our culture is thousands of years old the spread of this phenomenon is more evident here there must not be a single day in india when there is no festival connected with water in some corner of the country or the other during the period of magh people even leave their homes near and dear ones comforts and amenities to perform kalpvaas on the banks of rivers this time in haridwar kumbh too is being held for us water is life faith too and the flow of development as well in a way water is more important than paras the philosopher s stone it is said that with the touch of a paras iron gets turned into gold similarly the touch of water is necessary for life imperative for development friends possibly there is another reason to associate the month of magh with water after this winters come to an end and summers start knocking hence for the conservation of water we should begin efforts right away a few days later just on the 22nd of the month of march it s world water day aaradhya from u p has written to me that millions of people in the world spend a major part of their lives in overcoming water shortage it has not been said without reason bin paani sab soon without water everything comes to a naught in order to solve the water crisis sujit ji of north dinajpur has sent me a very nice message sujit ji has written that nature has bestowed upon us a collective gift in the form of water hence the responsibility of saving it is also collective it is correct that just as there is a collective gift there is a collective accountability too sujit ji s thought is absolutely correct river lake pond or ground water all of these are for everyone friends there was a time when in villages people would collectively look after wells and ponds now one such effort is underway at thiruvannamalai tamilnadu here local people have been running a campaign for the conservation of their wells these people are rejuvenating public wells in their vicinity that had been lying unused for years the endeavour of babita rajput ji of village agrotha in madhya pradesh will inspire all of you babita ji s village is in bundelkhand close to her village once there was a very large lake which had dried up she mobilized other women of the village itself and built a canal to bring water to the lake through this canal rainwater started flowing directly into the lake now this lake remains filled with water friends the work of jagdish kuniyal ji resident of bageshwar uttarakhand also teaches us a lot jagdish ji s village and the adjoining area were dependent on a natural source for their water requirements but many years ago the source dried up this led to worsening of the water crisis in the entire area jagdish ji decided to solve the crisis through tree plantation along with fellow villagers he planted thousands of trees over the entire area and today the dried up water source at the place is filled to the brim once again friends similarly we shall have to understand our collective responsibilities with regard to water in most parts of india rainfall begins in may june can we right away start a 100 day campaign for the sake of cleaning up water sources around us and conserving rainwater with this very thought in mind in a few days from now jal shakti abhiyan catch the rain is being initiated by the jal shakti ministry its credo is catch the rain where it falls when it falls we shall commit ourselves to the task right now we shall get existing rain water harvesting systems repaired clean up lakes and ponds in villages remove impediments in the way of water flowing into water sources thus we shall be able to conserve rainwater to the maximum my dear countrymen whenever a discussion on the month of magh and its spiritual social significance takes place the discourse is never complete without one name the name is that of sant ravidas ji sant ravidas ji s birth anniversary falls on the very day of magh poornima even today the words the knowledge of sant ravidas ji guide us on our path he d said ekai maati ke sabh bhaande sabh ka ekau sirjanhaar ravidas vyaapai ekai ghat bheetar sabh kau ekay ghadai kumhar all of us are earthen vessels of one clay all of us have been coiled and shaped by the one sant ravidas ji always expressed himself openly on the social ills that had pervaded society he laid bare social evils in front of society showed the path of redemption and that s why meera ji had said guru miliya raidas deenhi gyaan ki gutki it s my good fortune that i am connected with varanasi the birth place of sant ravidas ji i have experienced the spiritual loftiness of sant ravidas ji s life and his energy at the pilgrimage site friends ravidas ji used to say karam bandhan mein bandh rahiyo phal ki na tajjiyo aas karma maanush ka dharma hai sat bhaakhai ravidas meaning we should incessantly strive with our karma our work the phal the reward is bound to come your way this means karma leads to siddhi attainment with certitude our youth must learn one more thing from sant ravidas ji for doing any work they should not bind themselves to old methods and practices decide and shape your life yourself devise your own methods and practices set your goals yourselves if your conscience and self confidence is unshakeable you need not fear anything in the world i say so since often due to pressures of traditional thinking our youth are not able to do what they really like that is why you should never hesitate in thinking new doing new in the same manner sant ravidas ji has given another important message this message is to stand on one s own feet it is not fair at all that we remain dependant on others for our dreams things remaining to continue the way they are ravidas ji was never in favour of this today we see that the youth of the country too is not at all in favour of this thinking today when i see the innovative spirit of the youth of the country i feel ravidas ji too would have definitely felt proud of our youth my dear countrymen today happens to be the national science day too the day is dedicated to the discovery of raman effect by the great scientist of india dr c v raman yogeshwaran ji from kerala has written on namoapp that the discovery of raman effect had changed the direction of science in its entirety snehil ji from nasik too has sent me a very good message connected with this snehil ji has written that there are many scientists from our country without whose contribution science would not have progressed as much the way we know of other scientists of the world in the same way we should also know about the scientists of india i too agree with this view of these listeners of mann ki baat i definitely would want that our youth know understand and read a lot about the history of science of india about our scientists as well friends when we talk of science then many a time people restrict it to physics chemistry or labs but the spread of science is much more than that and there is a lot of contribution of the power of science in the atmanirbhar bharat campaign we have to move science forward with the mantra of lab to land chintala venkat reddy ji from hyderabad is an example a doctor friend of reddy ji once told him about the diseases caused by deficiency of vitamin d and the dangers thereof reddy ji is a farmer he thought about what he could do about solving this problem after this he worked a lot and developed breeds of wheat and rice that specially contained vitamin d this month itself he has received patent from world intellectual property organization geneva our government is fortunate that venkat reddy was also honoured with the padmashree last year similarly urugen futsog of ladakh too is working very innovatively at those heights urugen is growing about 20 crops organically that too in a cyclic way that is he utilises the waste of one crop as manure for the other crop isnt it amazing in the same way kamraj bhai choudhary from patan district in gujarat has developed good seeds of drum stick at home itself some people call drum stick as sargava or moringa drum sticks that are grown with the help of good seeds are of good quality too now by sending his produce to tamil nadu and west bengal he is raising his income also friends nowadays you must be hearing a lot the name of chia seeds people connected to health awareness give a lot of importance to it and it has a lot of demand too in the world in india it is mostly sourced from abroad but now people are taking up the challenge to be self reliant in chia seeds too similarly harishchandra ji of barabanki in up has begun farming of chia seeds cultivation of chia seeds will also increase his income and will help in the self reliant india campaign too friends many experiments of creating wealth from agricultural waste too are being run successfully in the entire country like murugesan ji from madurai made a machine to make ropes from waste of banana this innovation of murugesan ji will solve the issues of environment and filth too and will also pave the way for additional income for the farmers friends the purpose of talking about so many people to the listeners of mann ki baat is that we all should get motivated by them when every citizen of the country will spread the spirit of science in his life and in every field avenues of progress will also open up and the country will become self reliant too and i do believe that every citizen of the country can do this my dear friends ranjan ji from kolkata in his letter has raised a very interesting and fundamental question and along with that has tried to answer it in the best way he asks what it means to us when we talk of becoming self reliant in answer to this very question he himself further writes that self reliant india is not just a government policy but is a national spirit he believes that being self reliant means deciding one s own fate that is controlling one s own destiny ranjan babu is a hundred percent correct furthering what he has said i too would say that the first condition for self reliance is to have pride in the things of one s own country to take pride in the things made by people of one s own country when every countryman takes pride every countryman connects self reliant india doesn t remain just an economic campaign but becomes a national spirit when we see fighter plane tejas made in our own country doing acrobatics in the sky when made in india tanks made in india missiles increase our pride when we see made in india coaches in metro trains in wealthy advanced nations when we see made in india corona vaccines reaching dozens of countries then our heads rise higher and it is not that only bigger things will make india self reliant textiles made in india handicraft goods made by talented artisans of india electronic appliances of india mobiles of india in every field we have to raise this pride when we move forward with this thought only then will we become self reliant in the truest sense and friends i am happy that this mantra of self reliant india is reaching the villages of the country this very thing happened in bettiah about which i got to read in the media a resident of bettiah pramod ji worked as a technician in an led bulb manufacturing factory in delhi during his work in the factory he understood the intricacies of the entire process in great detail but during corona pramod ji had to return to his home do you know what pramod ji did after returning he himself started a small unit to manufacture led bulbs he brought along some youngsters from his area and completed the journey from being a factory worker to becoming a factory owner in a few months that too while living in his own house there is one more example from garhmukteshwar in up shriman santosh ji from garhmukteshwar has written how during the corona outbreak he turned adversity into opportunity santosh ji s ancestors were craftsmen par excellence they used to make mats when everything came to a halt at the time of corona these people began mat making with great energy and enthusiasm soon they started getting orders for their mats not only from uttar pradesh but also from other states santosh ji also narrated that with this the hundreds of years old beautiful art of this region has received a new strength friends there are many examples across the country where people are contributing in a similar manner to the atmanirbhar bharat abhiyan today it has become a sentiment flowing in the hearts of common folk my dear countrymen i saw an interesting post by mayur a resident of gurgaon on the namo app he is a passionate bird watcher and a nature lover mayur ji has written that while he lives in haryana he wishes us to touch upon the people of assam and in particular the people of kaziranga i thought that mayur ji would talk about the rhino hailed as the pride of kaziranga but mayur ji instead has asked for appreciation of the people of assam for the rise in the number of waterfowls in kaziranga i was searching for a common term to describe waterfowls in simple terminology and found the word jalpakshi birds that nest not on the trees but on the water such as ducks and others the kaziranga national park tiger reserve authority has been carrying out its annual waterfowls census for some time this census reveals the population of water birds and also about their favorite habitat just two three weeks ago the survey was conducted again you will also be delighted to know that this time the number of water birds has increased by about one hundred seventy five 175 percent compared to last year a total of 112 species of birds have been sighted in kaziranga national park during this census and of these 58 species happen to be winter migrants from different parts of the world including europe central asia and east asia the most important reason for this is that here there is better water conservation along with very little human interference however in some cases positive human interference is also very important just take the example of shri jadav payeng of assam with whom some of you certainly must be familiar he has received the padma award for his work shri jadav payeng is the person who actively contributed in raising about 300 hectares of plantations in the majuli island in assam he has been constantly working for forest conservation and is also involved in motivating people for plantation and conservation of biodiversity friends our temples in assam are also playing a unique role in the protection of nature if you take a look at our temples you will find that every temple has a pond in the vicinity the hayagriva madheb temple at hajo the nagashankar temple at sonitpur and the ugratara temple at guwahati have many such ponds nearby they are being used to save near extinct species of turtles assam is home to the highest number of species of turtles the ponds of theses temples can become excellent sites for their conservation and breeding and training about them my dear countrymen some people think that it is necessary to be a scientist to do innovation and some believe that it is essential to be a teacher to teach something to others those who challenge this line of thinking are worthy of praise now for example if anyone trains someone to become a soldier is it necessary for him to be a soldier you may be thinking that yes it is necessary but here is a little twist on mygov app kamalakant ji has shared a media report which states something different there is a gentleman in arakhuda in odisha nayak sir although his name is silu nayak everyone addresses him as nayak sir in reality he is a man on a mission he imparts free training to the youth who want to join the army the name of the organization of nayak sir is mahaguru battalion the training touches upon all the aspects from physical fitness to interviews and writing to training you will be surprised to know that the people this organization has trained have secured their places in uniformed forces such as the army navy air force crpf and bsf by the way you will also be amazed to know that silu nayak ji had himself tried to get recruited in odisha police but could not succeed despite this on the basis of his own training he has made many youth worthy of national service come let us all wish nayak sir greater success for preparing more heroes for our country friends sometimes even a very small and simple question rankles the mind these questions are not very long they are very simple yet they make us think a few days ago aparna reddy ji of hyderabad asked me one such question she said you have been pm for so many years and were cm for so many years do you ever feel that something is missing aparna ji s question seems simple but is equally difficult i pondered this over and told myself that one of my shortcomings was that i could not make much effort to learn tamil the oldest language in the world i could not make myself learn tamil it is such a beautiful language which is popular all over the world many people have told me a lot about the quality of tamil literature and the depth of the poems written in it india is a land of many languages which symbolizes our culture and pride speaking of language i want to share a small interesting clip with you sound clip statue of unity actually what you were listening to now is a guide at the statue of unity informing people in sanskrit about the tallest statue of sardar patel in the world you will be happy to know that there are more than 15 guides in kevadiya who guide people in fluent sanskrit now i present to you one more voice sound clip cricket commentary you too would have been surprised to hear this actually this is a cricket commentary being done in sanskrit in varanasi a cricket tournament is held among sanskrit colleges these colleges are shastharth college swami vedanti ved vidyapeeth sri brahma veda vidyalaya and international chandramouli charitable trust commentary is also done in sanskrit during the matches of this tournament i just played for you a very small part of that commentary not only this in this tournament players and commentators are seen in the traditional attire if you want energy excitement suspense all at once then you should listen to the sports commentaries long before the advent of tv sports commentary was the medium through which people of the country felt the thrill of sports like cricket and hockey the commentary for tennis and football matches is also very well presented we have seen that games in which commentaries are vibrant they get promoted and gain popularity very fast here too we have many indian sports where commentary culture has not permeated yet and due to this they are in a state of near extinction i have a thought why not have good commentaries of different sports and especially indian sports in more and more languages we must think about encouraging it i would urge the sports ministry and private institutional partners to think about it my dear young friends the coming few months are of special importance in the lives of all of you most of the young friends will have exams do all of you remember you have to become a warrior not a worrier go gleefully for the examination and come back

28-Jan-18,"In the first 'Mann Ki Baat' episode of 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the significance of women's empowerment in India, highlighting inspirational stories of women achieving remarkable feats in various fields. He emphasized the historical respect and importance given to women in Indian society and cited examples from Vedic times. The Prime Minister lauded women's achievements, including an all-woman staff running Matunga railway station and the female fighter pilots of the Indian Air Force. He also praised the 'Jan Aushadhi Yojana,' a healthcare initiative that provides affordable medicines to the public, and shared success stories of people benefiting from it.

He also highlighted the revamped Padma Awards selection process, acknowledging ordinary citizens and their significant contributions to society. The speech concluded with an appeal to commemorate Martyrs' Day on January 30, in honor of Mahatma Gandhi and other martyrs, and to continue following the path of peace and non-violence.",28-jan-2018 my dear countrymen namaskar this is the first episode of mann ki baat in the year 2018 just a couple of days ago we celebrated our republic day festival with gaiety fervour this is the very first time in history that heads of 10 nations attended the ceremony my dear countrymen shriman prakash tripathi has written a rather long letter on the narendra modi app urging me to touch upon the subjects he has referred to he writes the 1 st of february is the death anniversary of astronaut kalpana chawla she left us in the columbia space shuttle mishap but not without becoming a source of inspiration for millions of young people the world over i am thankful to bhai prakash ji for beginning his long letter with the sad departure of kalpana chawla it s a matter of sorrow for all of us that we lost kalpana chawla at that early age but her life her work is a message to young women across the world especially to those in india that there are no upper limits for nari shakti the power of women if one possesses the will the determination a firm resolve to achieve something nothing is impossible it s a matter of joy that women in india are taking rapid strides of advancement in all fields bringing glory to the nation in our country respect for women their status in society and their contribution has proved to be awe inspiring to the entire world since ancient times there has been a long tradition of vidushis women exponents or women champions many vidushis of india have contributed in composing the verses of the vedas lopamudra gargi maitreyee it s a long list of names today we talk about beti bachao beti padhao save the girl child educate her but centuries ago it has been mentioned in our ancient texts in the skand puran r this means a daughter is the equivalent of ten sons the punya that you earn through ten sons amounts to the same earned through just one daughter this underscores the importance that has been given to women in our society and that is why in our society women have been accorded the status of shakti this woman power binds closely together society as a whole the family as a whole on the axis of unity oneness be it the erudition of the vidushis of the vedic period lopamudra gargi maitreyee be it the learning devotion of akka mahadevi or meerabai be it the governance of ahilyabai holkar or the valour of rani lakshmibai woman power has always inspired us they have always brought glory to the nation shriman prakash tripathi has further cited some examples he writes that the flight of our courageous defence minister nirmala seetharaman in a sukhoi 30 fighter plane is inspirational for him he also refers to insv tarini with an all women crew on board under the command of vartika joshi which is currently circumnavigating the globe three braveheart women bhavna kanth mohana singh and avani chaturvedi have become fighter pilots and are undergoing training on the sukhoi 30 an air india boeing jet with an all woman crew led by kshamata vajpayee flew from delhi to san francisco usa and back these are all women achievers you are absolutely right today women are not just advancing in myriad fields they are leaders today there are many sectors where our woman power is playing a pioneering role establishing milestones a few days ago hon ble president took an initiative he met a group of extraordinary women who have achieved something significanty new in their respective fields women achievers of our country the first female merchant navy captain the first female passenger train driver the first female fire fighter the first female bus driver the first woman to set foot on antarctica the first woman to reach mount everest first ladies in every field our woman power achieved extraordinary feats breaking the age old shackles of social mores creating new records they proved that through perseverance grit and a firm resolve all kinds of obstacles and barriers can be broken crossed to chart out an all new path a path that could act as a beacon of inspiration not just to their contemporaries but for generations to come it will infuse afresh energy newer enthusiasm into them a book has beencompiled on these women achievers first ladies so that the entire country comes to know about the power of these women and derive inspiration from their life work this is also available as an e book on the narendra modi website the country s woman power has contributed a lot in the positive transformation being witnessed in our country society these days today as we speak of women empowerment i would like to refer to a railway station you must be wondering what a railway station has got to do with women empowerment matunga station in mumbai is the first station in india which is run by an all woman staff all departments have women performing duties the commercial department railway police ticket checking announcing point persons it s a staff comprising over 40 women this time after watching the republic day parade many people wrote on twitter and other social media that a major highlight of the parade was the bsf biker contingent comprising women participants daredevil stunts performed by them was awe inspiring for our foreign guests empowerment is another form of self reliance today our nari shakti is assuming leadership roles it is becoming self reliant by the way this also reminds me of tribal women of chattisgarh who have done something extraordinary and set a remarkable example when we refer to adivasi women a stereotypical image comes to our minds comprising jungles pathways in the woods and women carrying kindlewood on their heads but the woman power of chattisgarh the tribal women there broke this stereotype presented an all new picture of themselves dantewada in chattisgarh is a maoist infested region violence torture explosives guns pistols the maoists have created a scary reign of terror in this dangerous atmosphere adivasi women are becoming self reliant by driving e rickshaws in a short span of time a umber of women have become part of this phenomenon this has three benefits on the one hand self employment has empowered them on the other the maoist infested region is witnessing a transformation and simultaneously as a consequence it is strengthening efforts towards protecting the environment i laud the efforts of the district administration which has played a significant role in the successful endeavour of these women by ensuring availability of grants imparting training to them time and again we keep hearing people utter there is something special that we as a people possess no threat is big enough to annihilate our existence what is that special something that something is flexibility the ability of transformation leaving out things that are beyond the constraints of time and accepting betterment in things wherever necessary and this is a salient feature of our society relentless efforts towards self improvement self correction we have inherited this indian tradition as a cultural legacy the benchmark of any living society is its self correcting mechanism in our country there have been unending endeavours against social ills and evil practices both individually collectively just a while ago bihar launched an interesting initiative in order to uproot social ills in the state the world s longest human chain spanning over thirteen thousand kilometers was formed this campaign made people aware of social maladies such as child marriage and the dowry system the entire state thus resolved to fight against these social evils children the elderly the youth full of energy and enthusiasm women girls turned out to participate in this battle the human chain that commenced formation from gandhi maidan in patna gained momentum touching the state borders in order to ensure that the fruits of progress rightly reach all sections of society it is imperative that our society is freed of these ills come let us pledge to come together to wipe out these evil customs from our social fabric let us build an empowered capable new india i appreciate the people of bihar the chief minister the administration in fact every member of the human chain for this massive special initiative towards social welfare my dear countrymen shriman darshan from mysore karnataka has written on my gov he was undergoing an expenditure of six thousand rupees a month on medicines alone for the treatment of his father earlier he wasn t aware of the pradhan mantri jan aushadhi yojana but now that he s come to know of the jan aushadhi kendra he has begun purchasing medicines from there and his expenses have been reduced by about 75 he has expressed his wish that i mention this in mann ki baat so that it reaches the maximum number of people and they can benefit from it over some time lately many have written on this subject many of them have been telling me about it i too have seen videos put up on social media by beneficiaries of this scheme it is a matter of joy learning about happenings like these it gives you inner satisfaction i felt good to see shriman darshan ji think about sharing with others what he gained from it the motive behind this scheme is making healthcare affordable and encouraging ease of living medicines available at the jan aushadhi centres are 50 to 90 cheaper than branded drugs available in the market this is great help for the common man especially for senior citizens who require medicines on a daily basis and results in a lot of savings generic medicines sold under this scheme strictly conform to prescribed standards set by the world health organisation that is why good quality medicines are made available at affordable prices today over three thousand jan aushadhi kendras have been set up across the country this has led to not only availability of cheaper medicines but also new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs affordable medicines are now available at amrit stores at pradhan mantri bharatiya jan aushadhi centres at hospitals the sole aim behind this step is ensuring availability of quality affordable health service to the poorest of the poor so that a healthy prosperous india comes into being my dear countrymen shri mangesh from maharashtra has shared a photo on the narendra modi mobile app it was such a striking photo that my attention was magnetically drawn towards the photo showed that a grandson was participating in the clean morna river along with his grandfather i came to know that the citizens of akola had organized a cleanliness campaign to clean the morna river under the swachh bharat abhiyan the morna river was a perennial river flowing throughout the twelve months of the year but now it has become seasonal the second painful fact was that the river was completely filled with wild grass and hyacinth a lot of garbage was being dumped into the river and along its banks an action plan was chalked out and on january 13 th a day before makar sankranti in the first phase of mission clean morna sanitation of the two sides of the bank of the morna river at fourteen places spread over an area of four kilometers was carried out this noble and grand task named mission clean morna involved more than six thousand denizens of akola more than 100 ngos colleges students children the elderly mothers sisters almost everybody participated in this task on january 20 th 2018 this sanitation campaign continued in the same vein and i ve been told that this campaign will continue every saturday morning till the morna river is completely cleaned mission clean morna shows that if a person is determined to do something then nothing is impossible huge social reforms can be brought about through mass movements i congratulate the people of akola the district and the municipal corporation s administration all the citizens who were associated with this mass movement i laud your efforts which are not only very much appreciated but this will inspire the other citizens of the country my dear countrymen these days you must be hearing a lot about the padma awards these awards also attract attention innewspapers and television also but if you scrutinize then you will be proud of the fact that there many loftier personalities amidst us and you will naturally be proud of the very fact that today the common man is being cited for padma awards without any recommendations there was a certain methodology of awarding padma awards every year but this entire process has been changed for the past three years now any citizen can nominate any person in our country transparency has been brought about in the entire process by making it operable online in a way the selection of these awards has been transformed completely you may have noticed that many ordinary people not visible in big cities in newspapers or on tv are being awarded with padma citations now the identity of the awardee is not the deciding factor of the award rather the importance of his work is increasing you must have heard the name of arvind gupta ji it will gladden your heart to know that arvind ji a student of iit kanpur spent all his life creating toys for children he has been making toys from garbage for over four decades so that children can increase their curiosity towards science he has been trying to get children inspired to conduct scientific experiments using waste towards this end he has been encouraging children by showing them films made in 18 languages in three thousand schools across the country what a wonderful life what a dedicated mission a similar story is that of sitavaa jodatti from karnataka she has not been hailed as goddess of women empowerment just for nothing for the past three decades in belagavi she has made a great contribution towards changing the lives of countless women at the age of seven she had dedicated herself as a devadasi but in a turnaround for the welfare of the devdasis she has spent her entire life not only this she has done unprecedented work for the welfare of dalit women too you must have heard the name of bhajju shyam of madhya pradesh shri bhajju shyam was born in a very poor tribal family he was employed in a small job for eking out his living but he was also fond of painting in the traditional tribal art form today due to this hobby he garnered respect not only in india but the entire world he has exhibited his paintings in many countries like netherlands germany england and italy the talent of bhajju shyam ji who made india proud in many nations abroad was also recognized and he was awarded the padma shri you will be pleasantly surprised listening to the story of keralas tribal lady lakshmikutti laxmikutty is a teacher in kallar and still resides in a hut made of palm leaves in a tribal tract amidst dense forests she has created five hundred herbal medicines relying solely on her memory she has mastery in synthesizing medicines used for treatment of snake bites lakshmi ji is continuously serving society with her knowledge of herbal medicines identifying her anonymous persona she has been honoured with the padma shri for her contribution to society i would like to mention another name today that of 75 year old subhasini mistri hailing from west bengal who was selected for the award subhasini mistri is a woman who in order to construct a hospital cleaned utensils in the homes of others and also sold vegetables at the age of 23 she lost her husband due to lack of proper treatment and this incident inspired her to build a hospital for the poor today thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in this hospital that has come up through hard work i am convinced that there are many men and women in our land filled with gems bahuratna vasundhara many gifted women and men who remain faceless or unknown the failure to identify such people is also a loss to the society the padma awards are only a medium of acknowledgement but i would also like to tell the countrymen that people serving the society around us people giving up all that they have got for the sake of society millions of people who have worked for a life time for us bestowed with one or the other useful attribute should be acknowledged in our midst they do not labour for any honor but their work inspires us these people should be invited to schools and colleges to share their experiences beyond awards there should be some more efforts from our society in acknowledging their contribution my dear countrymen we celebrate pravasi bharatiya divas on january 9 th every year it was on the 9 th of january when our revered mahatma gandhi returned to india from south africa on this day we celebrate the unbreakable bond that exists between indians in india and indians living around the globe this year we organized a program on pravasi bharatiya divas where all mps and mayors of indian origin were invited you will be pleased to know that in this programme malaysia new zealand switzerland portugal mauritius fiji tanzania kenya canada britain surinam south africa and america and many other countries wherever our mayors or mps of indian origin exist all of them participated i am happy that the people of indian origin who live in different countries continue to serve those countries and at the same time they have maintained their strong relationship with india as well this time the european union has sent me a calendar in which they have displayed the contributions by indians in various fields of life living in different countries of europe whether working in the field of cyber security or dedicated to ayurveda entertaining the society through music or through poetry someone researching on climate change or working on ancient indian texts someone driving a truck for livelihood who went on to construct a gurudwara or has built a mosque wherever our people are they have in their own way embellished or adorned the land of their adoption i would thus like to thank the european union for recognizing the people of indian origin and through them in making people in india and people the world over aware of their exemplary work the 30 th of january is the death anniversary of our revered bapu who showed us a new path on that day we also observe martyrs day in solemn memory of the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the defense of the country and pay our homage at 11 in the morning the path of peace and non violence is the path of bapu and this is applicable not only for india or the world but also for a person or a family or a society the ideals which bapu practiced in his life things that he imparted are relevant even today they were not just mere theories at present we witness at every step how accurate bapus words were what can be a bigger tribute than taking a vow that we shall tread the path of bapu and walk as far as possible my dear countrymen with my best wishes to all of you for 2018 my speech draws to a

eagerly keep waiting for mann ki baat this time too numerous letters comments phone calls have poured in full of stories suggestions inspiration everybody wants to do something or the other also wanting to say it out one can feel that sentiment all this touches upon myriad facets which i wish to sum up but cannot do so on account of constraints of time duration it seems i am being put to test yet once again i want to offer you your own precious thoughts woven together on the singular thread of mann ki baat it must be part of your recent memory that in the earlier episode i had referred to a collection of short stories by premchand ji we had decided that on reading any book some of its facets should be shared with all through the narendra modi app i have seen that people in large numbers have shared a lot of information on a variety of books it is heartwarming to see them discuss books published on subjects such as science technology innovation history culture business life sketches and so on some have advised me to dwell upon many other books fine i shall discuss with you on other books as well but i must candidly admit here that i am not able to devote much time to reading books these days but i have gained a lot in the sense that based on your correspondence here i got opportunities to know about the themes of many kinds of books but the experience over the last one month makes me feel that we need to take it forward why don t we create a permanent book corner on the narendra modi app so that whenever we read a book we write about it and discuss it on this platform and you can even suggest an apt name for our book corner i want this book corner to be an active forum for readers writers alike so keep reading writing sharing with all friends of mann ki baat alongside friends i touched upon the subject of water conservation in mann ki baat and today i feel that it was an issue close to your heart even before i referred to it a matter of universal human interest i have experienced the fact that this topic has stirred the nation s heart strings collectively many an informed effective endeavour is afoot across the country people have shared information on traditional methods the media has embarked upon quite a few innovative campaigns be it the government or ngos something or the other is being carried out on a war footing witnessing the might of the collective is in itself heartwarming satisfying a case in point is village aara keram under the ormanjhi block not very far from ranchi in jharkhand the fervour zeal displayed by villagers there towards water conservation has turned out to be exemplary for one all the rural folk donated sweat toiling collectively to change the course of a mountain spring it was a purely indigenous home grown method this has led to not only stopping soil erosion prevention of crop damage but also facilitated effective irrigation of fields and you will be happy to know that the beautiful north eastern state of meghalaya has become the first state to have formulated its own water policy i congratulate the government of meghalaya in haryana crops that require meagre water are being encouraged farmers thus are saved from suffering losses i specially congratulate the haryana government for establishing a connect with the farmers to wean them away from conventional modes of farming towards crops that do not require much water it is the season of festivals many fairs are held on these occasions why don t we use these fairs to spread the message of water conservation all sections of society turn up in fairs in large numbers here we can effectively spread awareness on the need to save water through forums such as exhibitions and street plays thus using the festive fervour to convey the message of water conservation with ease friends certain turns in life make our hearts swell with joy zest especially our children s achievements their feats fill us up with energy and that is why today i feel like mentioning about a few children they are nidhi baipotu monish joshi devanshi rawat tanush jain harsh devdharkar anant tiwari preeti nag atharva deshmukh aronyatesh ganguli hrithik alaamandaa what i tell you about them will fill your hearts with pride verve as well all of us know that just the word cancer is more than enough to scare the world it conjures images of death waiting at the doorstep but each of these ten children not only fought against the dreaded disease cancer in their battle of life but also brought glory laurels to the country in sports and games we often get to see a player becoming a champion after winning a tournament or bagging a medal this was a rare occasion when the participants were champions before they entered the contest they were champions of life the battle actually this month the world children s winners games were held in moscow it is a unique sports tournament meant for young cancer survivors only they who have emerged fighting cancer can take part in this tournament sports games such as shooting chess swimming running football table tennis are organized all ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament out of these some players even won more than one medal my dear countrymen i firmly believe that you must have felt immensely proud on india s achievement beyond the skies in outer space chandrayaan ii people from across the country such as sanjiv haripura from jodhpur rajasthan mahendra kumar daga from kolkata p arvind rao from telangana and many others have written to me on narendra modi app and mygov urging me to speak on chandrayaan ii in mann ki baat in fact in the realms of space 2019 has been a very fruitful year for india our scientists launched the a sat in march after that amidst the hectic engagements during elections an important development such as the a sat could not be a prominent part of the discourse whereas the fact is through the a sat we have acquired the capability of destroying a satellite three hundred kilometres away in a mere three minutes india became the fourth country in the world possessing this capacity and now on the 22nd of july the nation watched with pride chandrayaan ii taking strides into space from sriharikota visuals of chandrayaan ii lifting off filled our countrymen s hearts with glory zest and joy chandrayaan ii is a mission that is special on many counts it will lead to a better understanding of the moon on our part we will be able to gather detailed information knowledge but if you ask me what the two greatest lessons i have received from chandrayaan ii i shall say they are faith fearlessness we should trust our talents capacities we should have faith in them you will be glad to know that chandrayaan ii is indian to the core it is thoroughly indian in heart spirit it is completely a swadeshi home grown mission this mission has proved beyond doubt once again that when it comes to attempting an endeavour in new age cutting edge areas with innovative zeal our scientists are second to none they are the best they are world class the second important lesson is never lose hope in the face of stumbling blocks or obstacles the way our scientists rectified technical issues in record time burning the midnight oil is in itself an exemplary unparalleled task the world watched the tapasya the awesome perseverance of our scientists we should also feel proud of the fact that despite hindrances there is no change in the arrival time many are amazed at that we have to face temporary setbacks in life but always remember the capacity to overcome them resides within us i fervently hope that the chandrayaan ii mission will inspire our youth towards science innovation after all science is the path to progress we are now expectantly waiting for the month of september when lander vikram rover pragyan will land on lunar surface through mann ki baat today i wish to share with students my young friends information on a very interesting competition i invite young boys girls to a quiz competition your inquisitiveness regarding space india s space mission science and technology will be the salient features of this quiz competition for example how is a rocket launched how is a satellite placed in orbit what information do we gather from a satellite what is a sat and many more of these the details of this competition will be available on the mygov website i urge my young friends students to participate in this competition and make it interesting and memorable through their participation i specially call upon schools parents enthusiastic teachers mentors to strive hard to ensure victory for their respective schools encourage all students to join and the most thrilling part is that students scoring the highest in their respective states will be invited to visit sriharikota with expenses borne by the government there in september they will get an opportunity to witness the moment when chandrayaan would be landing on the surface of the moon for these winners it will be a historic event of their life but for that you will have to participate in the quiz competition score the highest be a winner friends i m sure you must have liked my suggestion isn t this an interesting opportunity so let us not forget to participate in the quiz let us encourage inspire as many friends fellow students to do the same my dear countrymen you must have observed one thing our chain of mann ki baat has lent pace to the cleanliness campaign from time to time similarly efforts towards ensuring cleanliness have always inspired mann ki baat a journey that began five years ago gathered momentum with mass participation is now setting up newer benchmarks in cleanliness sanitation it is not that we have reached the ideal yet but the way we have achieved success in odf clean public spaces it displays the collective will strength of the resolve of a hundred thirty crore countrymen but we are not stopping at that this movement has now advanced from cleanliness towards beautification just a few days ago i was watching the story of shriman yogesh saini and his team on the media yogesh saini is an engineer who left his job in america and returned to serve mother india recently he has picked up the gauntlet to not just clean up delhi but to beautify it with his team he began with the garbage bins of lodi garden through the medium of street art he has decorated many localities of delhi with aesthetically appealing paintings from over bridges to school walls to hutments he gave a free hand to his talent garnering huge public support on the way on the lines of an effective campaign remember how during the kumbh prayagraj was decorated with street paintings i came to know that yogesh saini his team played a stellar role in it colours lines may be mute but when they merge to form a picture the rainbow that emanates speaks louder than a thousand words we experience this in the beauty the aesthetics of the swachchata abhiyan it is imperative that the culture of transforming waste to wealth develops in our society in a way we have to move ahead on the path of converting garbage to gold my dear countrymen a few days ago i read a very interesting comment on my gov this comment came from brother muhammad aslam who stays in shopian jammu kashmir he wrote i like listening to the programme mann ki baat i am happy to let you know that i played a positive active role in organizing the community mobilisation programme back to village in my state jammu kashmir this programme was organized in the month of june i feel such programmes should be organized every quarter simultaneously there should be a provision for online monitoring too according to me this was a one of a kind programme where the public directly entered into a dialogue with the government brother mohd aslam ji had sent me a message upon reading which i felt curious to know more about the back to village programme and when i got to knew it at length i felt that the entire nation should get to know about this programme the people of kashmir are eager to join the national main stream their enthusiasm is reflected in the mechanism of this programme for the first time senior officials reached the villages directly even those officials who had never visited a village were available to the villagers at their doorsteps to judge for themselves to gauge the obstacles in the path of progress and to remove the hurdles this week long programme encompassing about 4500 panchayats witnessed the govt officials briefing the villagers about the schemes and programmes implemented by the government and also inquired whether these facilities were available to them or not how to impart more might to the panchayats how to increase their income and how the facilities rendered by panchayats can affect the day to day life were topics that were discussed and people too interacted in a participatory fashion telling about their problems literacy sex ratio health hygiene water conservation electricity water girl education senior citizen s concerns etc were some of the topics that were discussed at length friends this programme was not a mere government formality that officials roam around the village and return to base instead of this the officials spent two days and a night at the panchayat enabling them to spend time in the village and meet almost every denizen of the village and to reach across to every establishment in the village to make this programme even more interesting many other means were employed many sports competitions for kids were organized under the aegis of khelo india sports kits mnrega job cards and sc st certificates were distributed there were financial literacy camps and agriculture and horticulture department set up stalls where knowledge about govt schemes was disseminated in this manner this programme became a festival celebrating development a festival of people s participation and a festival of people s awakening the people of kashmir open heartedly became equal stakeholders in this festival the most heartening aspect of back to village programme is the fact that it was organized in such remote villages where even officials had to traverse difficult terrain and climb mountains while walking on foot over a period of day or day and a half these officials also reached the panchayats on the border which live under the shadow of cross border firing not only this the officials reached the sensitive villages in the districts of shopian pulwama kulgam and anantnag without any fear some officers were so overwhelmed by the reception they received that they decided to extend their stay upto two days in these villages the organizing of gram sabhas in these villages wherein the people participated in large numbers and chalked out schemes for themselves is something that is an extremely pleasant experience a new resolve a new fervor and grand results programmes like these and people s participation or stake holding indicates that our brothers and sisters in kashmir want good governance and proves the dictum that the power of development is stronger than the might of bullets and bombs it is clear that those who wish to spread hatred en route to development pose hurdles will never succeed in their sinister plans my dear countrymen shriman dattatraya ramchandra bendre gyanpith laureate and poet has described the significance of the month of sawan in this manner in his poem meaning that the relationship between drizzling rain and stream of water is wondrous and earth gets bedazzled by such spectacle in entire india people of different cultures and languages celebrate the onset of rainy season in their own fashion whenever we look around us in this season it appears as if earth has draped itself in a sheet of greenery there is generation of renewed energy all around us in this pious season many devotees perform the kanwad yatra and many proceed on the amarnath pilgrimage many observe fasts and eagerly wait for festivals like janamasthmi and nag panchmi it is during this season that the festival of raksha bandhan symbolizing the bond between a brother and sister also falls while we are talking of the month of sawan you will be glad to learn that the number of pilgrims in the amarnath yatra this year has been the greatest in the past 4 years a total of 3 lakh pilgrims have had the darshan of the holy amarnath shrine from 1st july till now in 2015 the number of devotees who performed this pilgrimage over 60 days has been crossed over by the number of pilgrims in mere 28 days this year i would especially like to thank the hospitality of the people of jammu kashmir while referring to successful organization of amarnath yatra those who return after performing this pilgrimage become imbued with the feelings of warmth and kinship displayed by the people of the state these are portents of booming tourism in the future i have been told that within a span of a month and a half of the commencement of chardham yatra in uttarakhand this year more than 8 lakh devotees have had the darshan of kedarnath shrine this is a record number of pilgrims post the apocalyptic events of 2013 i

28-Jun-15,"In his Mann ki Baat address on June 28, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his pride in the overwhelming response to the 'Incredible India' photo campaign, where people shared diverse and picturesque images of the country on social media. He emphasized the global success of International Yoga Day, encouraging people to continue practicing yoga.

PM Modi concluded by wishing everyone a joyful monsoon and promising more updates in the next edition of Mann ki Baat.",28-jun-2015 namaskar my dear countrymen last time in mann ki baat i had requested you to send me memorable pictures if you go out on a vacation anywhere in india and if you happen to find them kindly post them under the incredible india hashtag when isaid that i had never imagined that it would get such an immense response lakhs of people have posted photos on twitter facebook and instagram i can say that india is full of diversities and i was able to witness so many magnificent scenes in those pictures be it of architecture art nature waterfalls mountains rivers or seas government of india had never thought that in terms of tourism you all could contribute in such a massive way i liked some pictures so much that i re tweeted them and as i understand if some one would not have posted the picture of belum caves in andhra pradesh many people would have never come to know that something like that exists in our country madhya pradesh s orcha fort is another example of that we assume rajasthan to be a state with scarcity of water but when someone sends a photo of menal waterfall it is a matter of great surprise really a tremendous work has been done we will promote and also continue doing such work and the entire world will watch it entire nation will watch it and our new generation will also watch it my beloved countrymen though you have elected me as the prime minister of the country but at times the human in me shuns all posts and prestige associated with it and submerges oneself within it i can say that 21st june the international yoga day affected me in the same manner at that time when i proposed the international yoga day it was just an idea but the scene that was witnessed on 21st june was such that wherever the sun dawned wherever its rays reached there was not a single landmass wherein it was not welcomed by way of yoga we can say with conviction that the sun never sets in the world of yoga practitioners the way yoga was received and was welcomed with open arms around the world there would not be any indian who would not be proud of it i too got delighted and when the people of france chose river seine and eiffel tower in which they take pride to do yoga they gave an equal status to it as river siene and eifel tower in new york people did yoga at times square if we think about sydney australia then the picture of opera house comes to our mind the citizens of australia gave equal respect to yoga and did yoga at the opera house whether it is north america silicon valley or milan s duomo cathedral it is a matter of great pride for us on 21st june when i saw mr ban ki moon un secretary general doing yoga at un headquarters i was really delighted similarly un peace keeping force did a spectacular display of yoga in india our soldiers too were doing yoga in siachen on white sheet of snow and on sea too wherever our naval ships are posted the yoga program was being carried out by indian navy delhi made it to the guinness book of world records rajpath turned into the yogpath that day i am thankful to india and the rest of the world and can say that the international yoga day was not for namesake it seemed as if that from every corner of the world there was a new inquisitiveness new joy new hope and new connection few days back when i tweeted a photo of a vietnamese child doing yoga it was such a sweet photo that it got a lot of attention from the entire world everybody be it men women old young village city developed or developing countries everybody got connected with it yoga in true terms became the core reason to connect the entire world i do not know how the intellectual class elites of the world would analyze this event but i can feel and every indian can experience that the whole world is very curious to know more about india curiosity towards india has increased the world wants to know about the values the rituals and the heritage of india it is our responsibility that without any artificiality we share our legacy and introduce ourselves to the world we can only do this when we ourselves are proud of our traditions at times we are so familiar with our values that we don t feel there is anything new in them but we ourselves do not know that our family values are considered to be a big thing in the entire world why don t we familiarize the outside world with our family values the world would be very surprised to know about them i am sure they would be intrigued there are many things that our forefathers have given to us which are the best and the entire world also has the right on those things the success of international yoga day has brought in a new responsibility along with it it is our responsibility that we gift supreme yoga teachers to the world it is our responsibility that we can see the entire tradition of yoga on one platform from the universe i request the youngsters especially the it professionals that all of you should come together to create an online yoga activity program we all should come to know about all the yoga organizations yoga teachers and all the necessary information about the yoga from this online program one database must be prepared and i believe you can do it one must start from somewhere and it would surely turn out to be a great power i have seen and learnt from the perspective of recent occurrences that a government that works and the government that is action oriented can bring in results if the targets are set we should not forget that the only voice that could be heard one year ago was that nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens can you imagine that there is a department under government named ayush nobody has paid attention towards this department the only mention ayush in some corner of the newspaper being a small department is once in 2 to 5 years but it led on the international yoga day it was this small department that organized this event in the entire world therefore this is an example that if there is an aim then even a small department can do a supreme job in the last few days the world saw how we saved people from yemen to afghanistan in a few hours we reached nepal and helped people over there when people wanted to open an bank account under the government s new scheme of jan dhan yojana how the people working in bank helped them to do so and connected millions of indians to the bank on 15th august last year when i appealed from the red fort for toilets in schools i had said that by next 15th august we have to complete this task the work which could not be completed in last 60 years was promised to be completed by the end of one year the promise was really daring almost four and half lakh toilets were to be built but i can say it with satisfaction that though 15th august is still far off the work of constructing toilets by the people is on the verge of completion this means that the government people and government workers all want to work for the country if we pledge to work in an unselfish manner welfare for all happiness for all then the government will also work efficiently the people who are a part of the government will also work efficiently and the people of the nation will welcome them with open arms i have experienced this this is the true strength that drives a nation forward last month we had launched three insurance schemes i had launched them from kolkata and it has received such a commendable response in such a short span of time there have been very few steps which have been taken from the perspective of social security but by way of these three schemes we are taking a big leap in such a short time span more than 10 crore people have become a part of these schemes but we have to take it further i have a thought which i want to put forth before you rakshabandhan comes in the month of august can t we start a massive movement before this festival and make every women be it our mother or sister a part of this thereby giving benefit to them under this insurance program be it a sister who is a domestic help in your home or your own sister why can t we gift them a rs 12 or rs 330 scheme on rakshabandhan for their entire life this can be a big gift for a sister from their brother why can t we set the eve of rakshabandhan as a target and in a number of 2 crore 5 crore 7 crore and 10 crore try to reach the sisters so that they can reap the benefit of this scheme let s come together and try to work together towards the completion of this pledge whenever i hold a mann ki baat session many people send me suggestions this time many people have suggested that i say something about the monsoons yogesh dandekar from nagpur harshvardhan ji from mysore praveen nadkarni ji divyanshu gupta ji have all asked me to say something about the monsoon in this session of mann ki baat they have sent in some really good suggestions and this is a season of happiness and each one of us whatever the age is definitely tempted to enjoy the first showers of the monsoon i am sure you too might be enjoying the rains with bhajiyas pakoras corn and a hot cup of tea just as the rays of the sun give us life similarly rainfall provide us life and sustenance every drop of water is precious as a responsible citizen and as a member of the society we will have to cultivate the habit of conserving every drop of water it should be our pledge that water from the villages stays in the villages and water for the cities remains available for them if the rain water does not flow away it goes into the earth then the aquifers get recharged and the year long water woes get resolved rain water harvesting is not a new concept it is being practiced over the centuries be it check dams watershed development small lakes or the small ponds in fields we need to save the precious waters everywhere i always tell people that if you go to porbander the birth place of mahatma gandhi you will be able to see a two hundred year old underground water tank which got directly recharged with the rain water you can still see it if you ever go there do visit the place and you will find that even after two hundred years it is still functional brimming with water and the water does not even stagnate porbander is a coastal city so potable water was collected through the rains for the entire year even in those times such a lot of care was taken we can too do the same this should in fact become a mass movement each and every village should have the facilities for rain water harvesting similarly we find greenery so pleasing to our eyes we all like greener surroundings gardens and trees bring in an element of freshness in our lives this monsoon season there should be mass plant sowing campaigns conducted by youth and social organizations and i can take a leaf from my personal experience and offer you a suggestion which has been very successful this is an intensely rural technology whenever you sow a plant place an earthen pot near it you just need to fill it once or twice in a month you will see how fast the plant grows into a lush green tree i have even been telling the farmers to plant trees on the boundaries of their fields instead of putting barricades these will become your biggest asset in the long run it is true that rains are enjoyable and bring in a lot of fun at the same time it is also true that rains also bring in many diseases doctors get to see so many patients that they hardly get the time to breathe we all know that rains cause many water borne diseases increased moisture in the environment leads to bacterial growth and so keeping the environment clean becomes important cleanliness is very important in monsoons it is often requested to consume safe drinking water most of the people boil and drink water during this season it has its own benefits and this is true that the more care we take healthier we would be we need monsoons and we need water but we also need to stay healthy dear citizens we have recently launched three schemes for the people in the cities we have around 500 small cities our policy is waste to wealth we can earn from waste too garbage can be recycled to make fertilizers bricks and even electricity contaminated water can be recycled to make it clent and be used for irrigation in the fields we have to take this movement forward in the amrut scheme we have launched a massive campaign and taken up initiatives to improve the quality of life in our cities we should become a country which is able to match the living standards of the world we should have smart cities comparable to world standards and yet at the same time the poorest of poor person should have an accommodation of his own and that too complete with water electricity sanitation and access to a school in 2022 when india celebrates its 75 years of independence we wish that every indian has a house of his own keeping all this in mind we have launched three major schemes i am positive that these schemes will bring about a qualitative difference in the lives of the urban people i am myself connected to you via the social media i keep getting many new suggestions and new ideas and also good and bad information about our government and sometimes it so happens that a small comment from an individual in some remote village in india conveys something that just touches our hearts you are aware that the government has launched beti bachao beti padhao programme but you can t imagine the force that is lent to the programme when a village or a society adopts it a few days back a sarpanch in a small remote village of haryana sri sunil jaglan ji launched selfie with daughter campaign such an environment was created that every father wished to click a selfie of himself with his daughter and post it on the social media i liked this idea and that too for a special reason in haryana the number of girls in comparison to boys is dismally low around another 100 districts in the country have a similar dismal situation of skewed sex ratio but it is the worst in haryana in that very same haryana if a sarpanch of a small indistinct village lends this meaning to the beti bachao beti padhao programme then i certainly get overwhelmed it makes me so happy and it gives me a new hope and i do express my happiness i request you all to take a selfie with your daughter and post it on selfie with daughter and do not forget to post a tagline around the theme of beti bachao beti padhao with it whatever be the language it can be in hindi english your mother tongue or your native language and i promise to re tweet the most inspirational tagline with you and your daughter s selfie we can turn beti bachao beti padhao into a mass movement i urge you all to take forward the programme launched by sri sunil in bibipur village of haryana i request you all to post on selfie with daughter lets us all enjoy the rising honour and prestige of our daughters and see how joyful this entire experience of beti bachao beti padhao becomes let us all rid ourselves of this bad name that we have for not respecting our daughters so my best wishes to you for the coming monsoon season may all of you enjoy the rains make our country clean and green and remember the international yoga day was not a single day initiative continue practicing yoga then see what difference it makes to you and your life and i say this from my experience please take this forward make yoga a part of your life and that initiative regarding incredible india do keep posting a picture of whichever part of the country you go to the country and the world will awaken to our diversity i felt that the handicrafts did not receive due attention do make it a point to post the handicrafts of the local region you visit there are so many things that people around you might be making the poor as well as the skilled might be creating do keep posting their pictures regularly we have to expand our reach to the world and make india known to the world we have an easy medium at our disposal and so we will all do it my dear countrymen that is all for today i shall meet you again in the next edition of mann ki baat many people expect me to announce some huge schemes during this programme but i am working day and night towards those this is my time for some light conversation with you all this gives me immense pleasure thank you very much ,"India is full of diversities and i was able to witness so many magnificent scenes in those pictures i re tweeted them and as i understand if some one would not have posted the picture of a vietnamese child doing yoga it was such a sweet photo that it got a lot of attention from the entire world everybody be it men, women, old young village city developed or developing countries everybody got connected with it yoga in true terms became the core reason to connect the whole world"
28-Jun-20,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on June 28, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reflects on the challenges faced by India in the first half of the year, including the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, and security issues. He emphasizes India's historical resilience and ability to overcome adversity, urging citizens not to judge the entire year based on its initial challenges. PM Modi acknowledges the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers, especially in the face of border tensions, and calls for support in making India self-reliant. He highlights the importance of adopting local products and industries. The address also encourages preserving and sharing traditional indoor games and taking care of the environment, particularly through rainwater harvesting. The Prime Minister pays tribute to former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, who led the country through a critical phase, as 2020 marks the beginning of his birth centenary year.",28-jun-2020 my dear countrymen namaskar mann ki baat has now attained the halfway mark in its journey for the year 2020 during this period we touched upon a multitude of subjects naturally much of our conversation revolved around the global pandemic the calamity that confronted the human race but i have been noticing these days an endless topic of discussion among people is when will this year go by phone conversations tend to begin with the lament why is this year moving on so sluggishly people are writing conversing with friends on how the year is not good some of them are expressing that 2020 is not auspicious people just want the year to be over one way or the other friends there are times when i feel why it isso it is possible that there are reasons behind such remarks just 6 7 months ago little did we know about the catastrophe that corona is nor had one expected the fight to go on this long as if one calamity weren t enough the country has had to face an unending slew of challenges day after day a few days ago our east coast had to face the fury of cyclone amphan on the west coast it was cyclone nisarg in many a state our farmer brothers and sisters had to bear the brunt of swarming locusts if nothing else many parts of the country have been witnessing intermittent earthquakes amidst all these the country has had to deal with the designs of some of our neighbours as a matter of fact rare are the occasions when one gets to hear of adversities of this kind that too simultaneously we have come to a stage where people are linking even minor incidents to these challenges friends adversities do descend upon us calamities do confront us but the question is should they lead us into the belief that the year 2020 is not good is it rational to presume on the basis of the first half that the entire year would be so not at all my dear countrymen absolutely not in a given year challenges could vary between one and say fifty the number does not determine the goodness of that year historically india has always emerged brighter and stronger ensuring victory over all kinds of disasters and challenges for centuries myriad tyrants invaded india pushing her to the edge of such an abyss of adversities that people once used to feel that the very idea the fabric of bharat would be wiped out her culture would be annihilated but india overcame the scourge and more gloriously so friends we are familiar with our adage creation is permanent creation is continuous i am reminded of a few lines of a song yeh kalkal chalchal behti kya kehta ganga dhara yug yug se behta aata yeh punya parwaah hamara gurgling and burbling what do the ripples of the ganga say for eons and eons unstoppable has been our mighty divine flow the song further says kya usko rok sakenge mitne wale mit jayien kankad pathar ki hasti kya badha bankar aaye who has the might to stem the steady flow many sank without a trace can pebbles and stones ever be an impediment to the divine grace india too on the one hand witnessed a series of colossal adversities on the other numerous forms of creations kept evolving overcoming hurdles literature saw resurgence new researches emerged new concepts were propounded this means even in the worst of times the process of creation went on undeterred in every field enriching our culture leading to our country s progress india has always transformed adversities into stepping stones to success with the same sentiment we have to move on march on in today s troubled times if you advance in step with 130 crore countrymen this year will prove to be a record setter path breaker on new fronts for the country this very year the country will attain newer goals reaching newer heights with all new wings i firmly believe in the collective might of 130 crore countrymen all of you i have firm belief in the glorious heritage of the country my dear countrymen irrespective of the magnitude of the calamity confronting us india s sanskar way of life inspires one and all to serve selflessly the way india extended a helping hand to the world during difficult times it has reinforced india s role in ushering in peace and development this period also saw the world realising india s spirit of universal brotherhood at the same time it also noticed india s commitment and might when it comes to safeguarding her sovereignty and territorial integrity those who cast an evil eye on indian soil in ladakh have got a befitting response india honours the spirit of friendship she is also capable of giving an appropriate response to any adversary without shying away our brave soldiers have proven that they will not let anyone cast an evil eye on the glory and honour of mother india friends the entire country comes together in paying tributes to the bravery of our jawans who attained martyrdom in ladakh the entire country bows to them in reverence with gratitude just like their family members every indian painfully regrets the loss the inner sense of pride that families feel on the supreme sacrifice of their brave sons their sentiment for the country constitutes the true power the might of the country you might have seen parents of martyrs referring to sending other sons other young family members too to join the army the words of the father of shaheed kundan kumar of bihar keep echoing he had mentioned sending even his grandsons to the army to defend the country this spirit permeates across all martyr families truly the sense of sacrifice displayed by these family members is worthy of veneration the resolve with which our jawans made the supreme sacrifice for the security of mother india should be the aim of our lives and this applies to each and every one of us our pursuits and endeavours should be in the same direction we should strive towards enhancing the country s capabilities and capacities in safeguarding our borders a self reliant india would be a tribute to our martyrs in the truest deepest sense rajni ji has written to me from assam she says after watching what happened in eastern ladakh she has taken a vow and the vow is that she will buy only local and for the sake of local she will also be vocal i am receiving messages on these lines from every corner of the country many have expressed through their letters that they have adopted this very path similarly mohan ramamurthy from madurai writes that he wishes india to be self reliant in the defence sector friends before independence in the realm of the defence sector our country was ahead of many countries in the world there used to be a multitude of ordnance factories many countries that lagged behind us then are ahead of us now after independence we should have made efforts in the defence sector taking advantage of our prior experience we did not but today in the fields of defence and technology india is relentlessly endeavouring to advance on those fronts india is taking strides towards self reliance friends no mission can be successfully achieved without people s participation and that is why on the path towards a self reliant india as a citizen our collective resolve commitment and support is necessary rather imperative when you buy local become vocal for local you play a role in strengthening the country this too in its own way is service to one s country whatever be your profession wherever there is ample scope in the realm of service to the country keeping in mind the requirement of the country whatever you do comes under this very spirit of service and this very spirit on your part lends strength to the country one way or the other we should also remember that the stronger our country is the possibilities of peace in the world will proportionately be bolstered it is said vidya vivadaya dhanam madaay shaktih pareshaan paripeednayakhalasya sadhoh vipareetam etat gyaanaydaanaych rakshanay which means a person who is wicked by nature uses education to foster conflict wealth for conceit and strength to trouble others whereas a gentleman uses education for knowledge wealth for helping and strength for protecting india has always used her might echoing the same sentiment india s solemn resolve is to safeguard her honour and sovereignty india s aim is a self reliant india india s tradition is trust and friendship india s spirit is brotherhood we shall keep moving ahead abiding by these principles my dear countrymen in these times of the corona crisis the country has moved out of the lockdown phase to the unlock phase during this unlock period one will have to focus deeply on two points defeating corona and strengthening the economy and bolstering it friends during the unlock period we have to stay more vigilant compared to the lockdown period only your alertness can save you from corona always remember if you do not wear a mask do not observe the two yard social distancing norms or do not take other precautions you are putting others at risk besides yourselves especially the elderly and children at home hence i urge all countrymen and i repeatedly do so do not be negligent take care of yourselves and others too friends during this unlock phase many other things are getting unlocked which had hitherto shackled the country for decades for years our mining sector was in a state of lockdown the decision to allow commercial auction has altered the scenario completely just a few days ago historic reforms in the space sector were brought in through these reforms the sector which was in a state of lockdown for years was set free this will not only pace up the movement towards self reliant india it will also boost up the advancement of technology in india if you glance at our agricultural sector you will notice that many aspects of this sector too were in a state of lockdown for decades this sector toohas now been unlocked this on the one hand grants freedom to farmers to sell their produce to anyone they wish to anywhere on the other hand this has paved the way for enhanced loans there are many such sectors in which amidst all crises our country is opening up new avenues of development through historic decisions my dear countrymen every month we come across stories in the news that touch our hearts they remind us how every indian is earnestly ready to help one another to the best extent possible according to one s capacity i got an opportunity to read one such inspiring story from arunachal pradesh on the media mirem village of siang district attempted a unique feat that has become an inspiration for india most residents of this village stay elsewhere working for their livelihood during the corona pandemic they were returning to the village the villagers on noticing that decided to make arrangements for their quarantine outside the village in advance they came together and erected 14 temporary huts at a short distance from the village deciding that when those people would reach the village they would first be quarantined for a few days in these huts the huts were equipped with toilets water and electricity including essential items for daily needs it is not surprising that this awareness and collective effort on the part of village folk of mirem attracted widespread attention and accolades friends it is said in our scriptures swabhavam najahatieva sadhuh aapadratopi san l karpoor pawak saprishta saurabham labhteetrama which means just like camphor does not abandon its fragrance even while burning in fire the virtuous do not forsake their qualities or their true nature while facing a disaster today the labour force of our country our worker brethren are an embodiment of this mantra you can witness for yourself these days there are so many stories of our migrant workers who have become a source of inspiriation for the entire country in u p the migrant workers who returned to the village of barabanki took an initiative to return the kalyani river to its pristine natural form upon witnessing this resolve to salvage the river the farmers and other people from nearby areas also got enthused after returning to their respective villages whilst spending their mandatory time in isolation or quarantine centres the manner in which our worker brethren have employed their skills to transform the conditions around them is amazing but friends there are many such stories from lakhs of villages in our country which still have not reached us as is the nature of our country i firmly believe friends that many such incidents must have occurred in your village or in your vicinity if such anincident has come to your attention you must write an account of such an inspiring event to me in this time of calamity these positive events these stirring stories will inspire the others my dear countrymen the corona virus has definitely changed the way we live i was reading a very interesting article in the financial times published from london it was written that during the corona pandemic the demand for spices including ginger turmeric and other spices has increased not only in asia but also in america the entire world is focused on increasing theirimmunity at this time and these immunity enhancing ingredients are linked with our country we should be able to communicate about their speciality in such easy and simple language to the people of the world that they can understand it easily and we can make our own contribution towardsmaking a healthier planet my dear countrymen if there would not have been a crisis like the corona pandemic we mightn t have pondered questions like what is life why there is life how is our life these are points we may have not thought of this is the very reason why many people have been living under mental stress and on the other hand people also shared with me how during lockdown they have re discovered the small facets of happiness in our lives many people have sent me their experiences of playing traditional in door games and revelling with the entire family friends our country has a very rich heritage of traditional sports for example you may have heard the name of a game called pachisi this game is played as pallanguli in tamil nadu is called ali guli mane in karnataka and is known as vamanguntlu in andhra pradesh it is a type of game employing strategy in which a board is usedwith many pits in which the players have to catch hold of the pellet or seed it is said that this game has spread from south india to southeast asia and then to the rest of theworld friends today every child knows about the game of snakes and ladders but do you know that this is also another traditional indian game called moksha patam or parampadam we also have another traditional game in our country called gutta this game is popular with elders and the children alike and involves simply getting hold of five small stones of the same size and behold you are ready to play gutta you ve to throw one stone into the air and while that stone is in the air you have to grab the remaining stones on the ground usually there isn t a need of any major contraptions in the indoor games prevalent in our country someone just brings along a chalk or a stone draws a few lines with it on the ground and a game is ready to be played in games requiring a dice improvisation is made with cowrie shells or tamarind seeds friends i do know that today while i m narrating about these games many must have returned to their childhood many of you must have got nostalgic about your childhood days i reiterate why have you forgotten those days why have you forgotten those games my request to the grandparents and the elders of the house if you do not handover these gamesto the new generation then who shall do it now that it has come to studying online in order to strike a balance and also to get rid of online gaming we must do so for the sake of our children herein also lies a novel and a strong opportunity for our start ups and even for our younger generation let us present the traditional indoor games of india in a new and attractive avatar those mobilizing theresources pertaining to these games the suppliers and start ups associated with these traditional indoor games will become very popular and we have to remember that our indian sports are also local and we have already pledged to be vocal for local and my little friends to the children of every household and my young friends today i am making a special request children will you accept my request see i appeal thatyou must do one thing that i am saying whenever you have a little time on your hands ask your parents to use the mobile and record the interview of your dada dadi nana nani or whosoever elder in the house you would have seen journalists conductinginterviews on tv you also do a similar kind of interview and record it on the mobile andwhat will be the questions you would be asking them let me give you some suggestions you must ask them about their lifestyle as children what sports they played sometimes if they went to the theatre orwent to the cinema sometimes if they had gone to their maternal uncle s house during holidays or visit a field or a barn how they celebrated the festivals there are many a topics upon which you can ask questions they too will like reminiscing about life 40 to 50 years or say 60 years ago and it will give them a lot of joy and for you too it would be great fun to learn about india 40 50 years ago how the area was where you presently live how were the nearby precincts and what the ways and customs of the people then were you will get to learn and know about these things quite easily you will find for yourself that it will be fun and it can become a good video album a very invaluable treasure for the family friends it is true that an autobiography or biography is a very useful tool to get closer to the veracity of history you too while chattingwith your elders will be able to understand about their times their childhood and the facets of their youth this is an excellent opportunity that the elders will get to narrate about their childhood and about their period to the children of their home friends monsoon has now reached large parts of the countryand meteorologists are very enthusiastic about the rains and are full of hope if the rainsare bountiful our farmers will reap a bumper harvest and the environment will also be green in the rainy season nature also rejuvenates itself as human beings exploit natural resources nature in a way during rains replenishes and restocks them but this refilling is possible only if we support our mother earth and carry out our responsibilities a little effort by us helps nature and environment quite significantly many of our countrymen are putting extraordinary efforts in thisendeavour in mandavali karnataka there is an 80 85 year old elder kamegowda kamegowdaji is an ordinary farmer albeit possessing an extraordinary personality he has achieved a personal feat that will leave anyone awestruck kamegowdaji aged 80 85 takes out his animals for grazing but at the same time he has taken it upon himself to build new ponds in his area he wants to overcome the problem of water scarcity in his area therefore in the work of water conservation he is engaged in the work of constructing small ponds you will be surprised that an octagenerarian likekamegowdaji till now has dug 16 ponds through his hard work and the sweat of his brow it is possible that the ponds he has constructed may not be very big but then his efforts are huge today the entire area has got a new lease of life on account of these ponds friends vadodara in gujarat is also an inspirational example here the district administration and the local residents together organized an interesting campaign due to this campaign today rain water harvesting has been initiated in one thousand schools of vadodara consequently it is estimated that on an average about 100 million litres of water is being conserved annually friends during this rainy season we should also take the initiative to think and do something similar to protect nature and to protect the environment just like at many places preparations would have begun for ganesh chaturthi can we try this time to make eco friendly ganesh statues and worship only them can we forego the worship of such idols which after being immersed in rivers or ponds become a hazard for the water and the living organisms in it i firmly believe that you will respond to my call amidst this we should be on guard from various ailments that surface with monsoon during the corona pandemic we have to protect ourselves from these diseases also keep using ayurvedic medicines herbal decoction and hot water to stay healthy my dear countrymen today on the 28th of june india is paying homage to one of her former prime ministers who led the country through a critical phase this day marks the commencement of the birth centenary year of our former prime minister shri pv narasimha rao ji when we talk about shripv narasimha rao ji naturally his image that emerges before us is that of a political leader but it is also true that he was a polyglot he used to speak many indian and foreign languages he was rooted in indian values and had knowledge of western literature and science as well he was one of the most experienced leaders of india but there is another aspect of his life which is remarkable that we should know friends narasimha rao ji had joined the freedom movement in his teens and when the nizam of hyderabad refused permission to sing vandemataram he took an active part in the movement against the nizam and at that time he was only 17 years old from a young age shriman narasimha rao was ever onward in raising his voice against injustice he left no stone unturned to raise his voice narasimha rao ji also understood history very well his rise from a very simple background his emphasis on

letters comments the varied inputs that keep pouring in for mann ki baat many people recalled a very important point on mygov aryan shri anup rao from bengaluru devesh from noida sujeet from thane all of them said modi ji this time it s the 75th episode of mann ki baat congratulations for that i express my gratitude to you for following mann ki baat so minutely for staying connected as well for me it s a matter of deep pride it s a matter of joy from my side it s of course thanks to you i also express thanks to all the listeners of mann ki baat since this journey just wouldn t have been possible without your support it seems like just yesterday when we had embarked upon this journey of thoughts and ideas then on the 3rd of october 2014 it was the pious occasion of vijayadashmi look at the coincidence today it is holika dahan may one lamp light another thus illuminating the nation treading along this sentiment we ve traversed this way we spoke to people across each and every corner of the country and learnt about their extraordinary work you too must have experienced that even in the remotest corners of our country there lies vast unparalleled potential myriad gems are being nurtured ensconced in the lap of mother india well for me it has been a phenomenal experience in itself to watch society know about society realizing her strength during these 75 episodes one went through a multitude of subjects at times there was reference to rivers at other times the peaks of the himalayas were touched upon sometimes matters pertaining to deserts at other times taking up natural disasters sometimes soaking in innumerable stories on service to humanity in some inventions in technology in others the story of an experience of doing something novel in an unknown corner you see whether it s about sanitation or a discussion on conserving our heritage and not just that reference to making toys what is it that was not there perhaps the sheer number of topics that we touched upon would turn out to be countless during all this from time to time we paid tributes to great luminaries whose contribution in the building of india has been unparalleled we learnt about them we also spoke on many global matters we ve tried to derive inspiration from them there were many points that you told me you gave me many ideas in a way in this vichar yatra journey of thought and idea you kept walking together kept connecting adding something new throughout during this 75th episode at the outset i express my heartfelt thanks to each and every listener of mann ki baat for making it a success enriching it and staying connected my dear countrymen you see how big a pleasant coincidence it is that today i got an opportunity to express my 75th mann ki baat this very month is the one that marks the commencement of amrit mahotsav of the 75 years of independence amrit mahotsav had begun from the day of dandi yatra and will continue till the 15th of august 2023 programmes in connection with amrit mahotsav are being held throughout the country consistently people are sharing information and pictures of these programmes from a multitude of places naveen from jharkhand has sent me a message on namoapp along with some such pictures he has written that he watched programmes on amrit mahotsav and decided that he would visit at least ten places connected with the freedom struggle the first name on his list is that of the birthplace of bhagwan birsa munda naveen has written that he will disseminate stories of the tribal freedom fighters of jharkhand to other parts of the country bhai naveen i congratulate you on your thought friends be it the struggle saga of a freedom fighter be it the history of a place or any cultural story from the country you can bring it to the fore during amrit mahotsav you can become a means to connect the countrymen with it you will see by and by amrit mahotsav will be filled up with similar inspiring drops of nectar and then the elixir that will flow will inspire us till a hundred years of the independence of india it will elevate the country to newer heights begetting a fervor to do something or the other for the country in the struggle for freedom our fighters underwent innumerable hardships since they considered sacrifice for the sake of the country as their duty may the immortal saga of their sacrifice tyaag and balidan continuously inspire us towards the path of duty and as bhagwan krishna has said in the gita niyatam kuru karma twam karma jyaayo hyakarmanah along the same sentiment may all of us fulfill our assigned duties faithfully and the amrit mahotsav of our freedom implies that we make new resolves and to realize those resolves we persevere wholeheartedly with due diligence and resolves should be such that are meant for welfare of society for the good of the country for a bright future for india resolves should be such in which the self assumes one responsibility or the other intertwined with one s own duty i do believe we possess this golden opportunity to embody live the gita my dear countrymen last year it was this very month of march when the country heard the term janata curfew for the first time just have a look at the experience of the might of the great praja people of this great country janata curfew had become a bewilderment to the entire world it was an unprecedented example of discipline generations to come will certainly feel proud at that similarly expressing honour respect for our corona warriors ringing thaalis applauding lighting a lamp you cannot imagine how much it had touched the hearts of corona warriors and that is the very reason they resolutely held on the whole year without tiring without halting steadfastly they endured to save the life of each and every citizen of the country last year around this time the question that was looming was by when would the corona vaccine come friends it s a matter of honour for everyone that today india is running the world s largest vaccination programme pushpa shukla ji from bhubaneshwar has written to me about photographs of the vaccination programme she urges that i should discuss in mann ki baat the enthusiasm visible in the elderly of the household regarding the vaccine friends it is right as well we are getting to hear such news from all corners of the country we are seeing such pictures that touch our hearts 109 year old elderly mother from jaunpur up ram dulaiya ji has taken the vaccination similarly 107 year old kewal krishna ji in delhi has taken the dose of the vaccine 100 year old jai chaudhary from hyderabad has taken the vaccine and it s an appeal to all to take the vaccine i am observing on twitter facebook how after getting the vaccine for the elderly of their homes people are uploading their pictures a youth anandan nair from kerala in fact has given a new term to this vaccine service similar messages have been sent by shivani from delhi himanshu from himachal and many other youths i appreciate these thoughts of all you listeners amidst all these do remember the mantra to fight corona dawaayibhikadaayibhi it is not that i have to just say we have to live too speak too tell too and keep making people committed to dawayibhikadayeebhi too my dear countrymen today i have to thank soumya ji who lives in indore she has drawn my attention to a subject and urged me to mention it in man kibaat this subject is the new record of indian cricketer mitaaliraaj recently mitaaliraaj ji has become the first indian woman cricketer to have made ten thousand runs many congratulations to her on this achievement she also is the only international woman player to score seven thousand runs in one day internationals her contribution in the field of women s cricket is fabulous mitali raj ji has inspired millions during her more than two decades long career the story of her perseverance and success is an inspiration not just for women cricketers but for men cricketers too friends it is interesting in the month of march itself when we were celebrating women s day many women players secured records and medals in their name india bagged the top position during the issf world cup shooting organised at delhi india also topped the gold medals tally this was possible because of the fabulous display by indian women and men shooters meanwhile p v sindhu ji has won the silver medal in the bwf swiss open super 300 tournament today from education to entrepreneurship armed forces to science and technology the country s daughters are making a distinct mark everywhere i am especially happy that daughters are making a new place for themselves in sports sports is coming up as a preferred choice in professional choices my dear countrymen do you remember the maritime india summit held sometime ago do you remember what i had said at this summit naturally so many programmes keep happening so many things get said how does one remember all and how does one pay attention either naturally but i felt nice that guru prasad ji carried forward one of my requests with interest at this summit i had talked of developing tourism facilities around the light house complexes in the country guru prasad ji has shared experiences of his travel in 2019 to two light houses chennai light house and mahabalipuram light house he has shared very interesting facts which will astonish even the listeners of man kibaat for example chennai light house is one of those select light houses of the world which have elevators not only this it is also the only light house in india which is within the city limits it has solar panels too for electricity guru prasad ji also talked about the heritage museum of the light house which brings forth the history of marine navigation giant wicks of oil lamps kerosene lights petroleum vapour and electric lamps that were used in olden times are exhibited at the museum guru prasad ji has also written in detail about the oldest light house of india mahabalipuram light house he says that beside this light house there is the ulkaneshwar temple built hundreds of years ago by pallava king mahendraverman first friends i have talked of different aspects of tourism several times during man kibaat but these light houses are unique in terms of tourism because of their grand structures light houses have always been centres of attraction for people to promote tourism 71 light houses have been identified in india too in all these light houses depending on their capacities museums amphi theatres open air theatres cafeterias children s parks eco friendly cottages and landscaping will bebuilt by the way as we are talking of light houses i would also like to tell you about a unique light house this light house is at a place called jinjhuwada in surendra nagar district of gujarat do you know why this light house is special it is special because now the sea coast is more than a hundred kilometers away from where this light house is you will find such stones too in thisvillage which tell us that there must have been a busy harbour here in the past that means earlier the coastline was up to jinjhuwada advancing receding moving back retreating so far away of the sea is also a feature of it this month it is going to be 10 years since the horrifying tsunami that hit japan thousands of people had lost their lives to this tsunami a similar tsunami had hit india in 2004 during the tsunami we lost 14 of our employees working at our light house they were on duty at the light houses in andaman nicobar and tamilnadu i pay respectful homage to these hard workinglight keepers of ours and have high regard for their work dear countrymen novelty modernization is essential in all fields of life otherwise it becomes a burden at times modernization in the field of indian agriculture is the need of the hour it is already late we have already lost a lot of time adopting new alternatives new innovations along with traditional farming are equally important to create new opportunities for employment in the agriculture sector to increase the income of farmers the country has experienced it during the white revolution now bee farming is emerging as a similar alternative bee farming is becoming the foundation of a honey revolution or sweet revolution in the country farmers in large numbers of farmers are associating with it innovating just as a village gurdum in darjeeling west bengal there are steep mountains geographical problems and yet people here started the work of honey bee farming and today there is a sizeable demand for honey harvested at this place this is also increasingthe income of farmers the natural organic honey of the sunderbans areas of west bengal is in great demand in our country and the world i also have had one such personal experience in gujarat an event was organized in the year 2016 in banaskantha gujarat in that programme i had told the people that there were so many possibilities here why not banaskantha and the farmers here write a new chapter of the sweet revolution you will be happy to know that in such a short time banaskantha has become a major centre for honey production today farmers of banaskantha are earning lakhs of rupees annually through honey there is a similar example too from yamuna nagar haryana in yamuna nagar farmers are producing several hundred tons of honey annually enhancing their income by doing bee farming the result of this hard work of the farmers is that the production of honey in the country is continuously increasing and annually nearly 1 25 lakh tons isproduced and out of this produce a large quantity of honey is also being exported to foreign countries friends honey bee farming do not lead to income solely from honey but bee wax is also a very big source of income there is demand for bee wax in everything pharmaceutical food textile and cosmetic industries our country currently imports bee wax but our farmers are now rapidly transforming this situation that is in a way contributing in the atmanirbhar bharat campaign today the whole world is looking at ayurveda and natural health products in such a situation the demand for honey is increasing even more rapidly i wish more and more farmers of our country to join bee farming along with their farming this will lead to an increase in the income of the farmers too and will also sweeten their lives my dear countrymen world sparrow day was celebrated just a few days ago sparrow that is goraiya at places is also known aschakali or it is also calledchimni orghanchirika earlier goraiyawould be found chirping on theboundaries of the walls of our houses or the neighbouing trees but now people recollectgoraiya by telling you that last they had seen goraiyawas many years ago today we are required to make efforts to save it my friend hailing from benaras indrapal singh batra has initiated a novel effort in this direction that i would like to certainly tell this to the listeners of mann ki baat batra ji has turned his own house into home for the goraiya he got such wooden nests made in his house where thegoraiya could dwell easily today many homes inbenaras are joining this campaign this has led to creating a wonderful natural environment in the houses i would like that for nature environment animals birdsor for whomsoever small or big efforts should be made by us just as a friend bijay kumar kabiji bijayji hails from kendrapada in odisha kendrapara is on the sea coast that s why there are many villages in this district which are prone to the dangers of high tides and cyclone this also causes havoc at times bijoyji felt that if anything can stop this environmental devatation theonly thing that can stop it it is only nature that is when bijayji began his mission from the village of barakot and for12 years friends toiling for the next 12 years he raised a 25 acre mangrove forest on the outskirts of the village towards the sea today this forest is protecting this village an engineer amreshsamantji has done similar work in paradip district of odisha amreshji has planted micro forests which are protecting many villages today friends in endeavour s of thesekinds if we involve the society great results accrue for example there ismarimuthuyoganathan who works as a bus conductor in coimbatore tamil nadu yoganathanjiwhile issuing tickets to the passengers of his busalso gives a sapling free of cost in this way yoganathanji has got planted of innumerable trees yoganathanji has been spending a big chunk of his salary towards this work now after listening to this story who as a citizen will not appreciate the work of marimuthu yoganathan i heartily congratulate his efforts for his inspirational work my dear countrymen we have all seen heard and mention to others about converting waste into wealth in the same way efforts of converting waste to value are also being attempted one such example is that of st teresa s college in kochi kerala i remember that in 2017 i attended a programme centred on book reading on the campus of this college students of this college are making reusable toys that too in a very creative manner these students are converting old clothes discarded wooden pieces bags and boxes into making toys some students are making a puzzle while another make a car orconstruct a train here special attention is paid to ensure that the toys are safe as well as child friendly and a good thing about this whole effort is that these toys are given to the anganwadi children for them to play with today while india is moving much forward in the manufacturing of toys these campaigns from waste to value these ingenious experiments mean a lot there is professor srinivasa padkandlaji in vijayawada andhra pradesh he isdoing very interesting work he has created sculptures from automobile metal scrap these huge sculptures made by him have been installed in public parks and people watch these with great enthusiasm this is an innovative experiment with electronic and automobile waste recycling i once again applaud these efforts of kochi and vijayawada and hope that a greater number of people will come forward in such efforts my dear countrymen when people of india visit any corner of the world they proudly say that they are indians we have a lot to be proud of our yoga ayurveda philosophy and what not that we talk about with pride we are as well proud of our local language dialect identity dress food and drink we have to attain the new for that is what life is but at the same time we don t have to lose our past we have to work really hard to enrich the immense cultural heritage around us for it to be passed on tothe new generation today sikari tissau who lives in assam is doing this very diligently sikari tissau ji of karbi anglong district has been documenting the karbi language for the last 20 years once upon a time in another era karbi the language of karbi tribal brothers and sisters is now disappearing from the mainstream shriman sikari tissau decided that he would protect identity of theirs and today his efforts have resulted in documentation of much information about the karbi language he has also received accolades at many places for his efforts and has also received awards i of course congratulate shriman sikari tissau ji through mann ki baat but in many corners of the country there will be many seekers like this slogging in such initiatives and i also congratulate them all my dear countrymen any new beginning is always very special new beginning means new possibilities new efforts and new efforts mean new energy and new vigor that is the reason it has been a tradition to observe any new beginning as a celebration in different states and regions and in our culture full of diversity and this time is the beginning of new beginnings and arrival of new festivals holi too is a tradition to celebrate basant spring as a festival when we are celebrating holi with colors at the same time even spring spreads new colours all around us at this very time flowers start blooming and nature comes alive new year will also be celebrated in different regions of the country soon be it ugadi or puthandu gudi padwa or bihu navreh or poila or boishakh or baisakhi the whole country will be drenched in the color of zeal enthusiasm and new expectations at the same time kerala also celebrates the beautiful festival of vishu after this soon the holy occasion of chaitra navratri will also come on the ninth day of the month of chaitra we have the festival of ram navami it is also celebrated as the birth anniversary of lord rama and the beginning of a new era of justice and parakram valour during this time there is an atmosphere of devotion along with pomp around which brings people closer connects them with family and society strengthens mutual

celebration of the resurrection of jesus christ symbolically easter is associated with the new beginning of life easter is a symbol of the resurrection of expectations on this holy and auspicious occasion i greet not only the christian community in india but also christians globally my dear countrymen today in mann ki baat we talked about amrit mahotsav and our duties towards the country we

the year s summer but we are now awaiting the rains as i am talking to you today the holy month of ramzan has already commenced i convey my hearty greetings to all fellow indians and everyone across the world especially the muslim brethren at the advent of this auspicious month of ramazan prayer spirituality and charity are accorded the highest priority during ramzan we indians are very lucky that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today india and its 1 25 billion people can take pride in the fact that people from all communities and faith are available here this is a country where both theists and atheists idolaters and those loathing idol worship co exist we have adapted ourselves to myriad kinds of ideologies different ways of worshipping and all types of traditions and imbibed the art of co existential living in the ultimate any religion faith ideology or tradition give us the message of peace unity and goodwill this holy month of ramzan will definitely be helpful in further strengthening these values of peace unity and goodwill i once again convey my best wishes to all last time around while sharing my thoughts in mann ki baat i had mentioned a new word and had specially exhorted our youth to do something new to come out of the comfort zone experience new things as this is the age when one can experiment and take risks and accept new challenges of life i am glad that many people have given me feedback all of them showed enthusiasm by personally speaking out their minds to me i could not read them all nor could listen to all the messages because there were such a large number of messages but whatever i could see from a cursory look that while some made efforts to learn music some tried hands on a new musical instrument some of them are trying to learn new things by using youtube some are trying to learn a new language some are learning cooking some others are learning dance and drama some have written that they have now started to write poems they are making efforts to know about nature and are learning the art of living and trying to understand the world i am extremely happy and want to share one of the phone calls with you i am diksha katiyal speaking i had almost left the habit of reading therefore i decided to pick up the habit during vacations when i started reading about the freedom struggle it was then i realized that how much struggle was involved in getting india freed how much sacrifices were given and how so many freedom fighters spent years in prison i am particularly inspired by bhagat singh who achieved so much at such a young age therefore i request you that you tell something to the younger generation today on this topic i am delighted that younger generation is taking interest in knowing about our history about our freedom fighters and about those who made sacrifices for the country countless great men spent their youth in jails several youngsters went to the gallows they suffered despicable miseries and that is how we can now breathe in a free india we see all those great men who spent their time in jails did a great job of writing and reading their writings provided a great strength and inspiration to our freedom movement many years ago i visited andaman nicobar islands i went to see the cellular jail there today is the birth anniversary of veer savarkarji veer savarkarji had written a book majhi jannmathep while in incarceration he used to write poems on the walls of his prison cell he was confined to a very small cell these seekers freedom must have gone through immense torture i was inspired to visit the cellular jail only after reading savarkarji s book maazi janmthep a light and sound show is also shown there which is very inspiring there was hardly any state in india youths from which were not exiled to the dark waters of andamans and were forced to spend their youth in this cellular jail during the freedom movement included people of every language every state and every generation had faced tortures during this struggle today is the birth anniversary of veer savarkarjee i would definitely want to tell our younger generation that to even perceive what kind of torture and trouble these freedom fighters had suffered to achieve freedom for us one must visit this cellular jail once we go there we come to know as to why this was called kaalaa paani or the dark waters if you get a chance please pay a visit to this place which is actually a pilgrimage of our freedom struggle my dear countrymen 5th of june is the first monday of the month everything is otherwise normal yet 5th of june is a special day as this is observed as world environment day this year the united nations have chosen the theme connecting people to nature in other words we may say back to basics and what s the meaning of connecting with nature in my view it means getting connected with one s own self connecting with nature means nurturing a better planet and who can explain this in a better way than mahatma gandhi mahatma gandhi often used to say one must care about a world one will not see this means that it is our duty to be concerned about the world which we shall not see and to care for that nature possesses a special power you might have also observed that whenever we feel tired and exhausted splashing a glass of water on our face has a wonderful rejuvenating effect if you return after a tiring day s work just open the windows and doors of the room and take a deep breath of fresh air this will fill you with fresh energy our body is made up of five basic elements and whenever we come in contact with these elements we get fresh energy all of us have experienced this but we do not register this we do not connect this in a single thread of sequence now on kindly make it a point to notice that whenever you come in contact with a natural condition a new spirit emerges from within you so the global campaign of connecting with nature on 5th june should become our individual campaign as well and we are reaping the benefits of the efforts made by our ancestors to save the environment and if we shall protect the environment our future generations will reap the benefits vedas describe the earth and the environment as the basic sources of energy and atharva veda written thousands of years ago is the most authentic guiding scripture about nature and environment in india it has been said earth is the mother and i am her son according to vedas the purity within us is because of the earth the earth is our mother and we all are her children if we recall lord buddha a fact comes to light that his birth his enlightenment and his mahaparinirvana all three happened under a tree we have many festivals and religious rituals which are based on worshiping nature and affection towards nature is a part of our everyday life this is true in case of all sections of society whether lettered or unlettered rural or urban and even tribal communities but we need to present this in modern language and integrate with modern arguments these days i keep receiving news from our states almost in every state a big plantation campaign gets underway with the onset of monsoon millions of trees are planted school children social organizations and ngos also get connected with the campaign even state governments take an initiative let us also make our contribution in enhancing this campaign my dear countrymen 21st june has become a well known day world over the whole world observes this as world yoga day in a very short time 21st june has got worldwide recognition as world yoga day and is connecting people at a time when separatist forces are raising their ugly heads this has been india s great contribution to the world we have successfully connected the whole world through yoga like yoga connects body mind heart and soul similarly it is connecting the world now because of life style because of the mad race to achieve success and because of increasing responsibilities leading a stress free life has become very difficult it is seen this situation is coming up even at a comparatively younger age at a time when people are gobbling up medicines indiscriminately and passing their days yoga plays a very vital role in helping people to lead a stress free life yoga is a guarantee of wellness and fitness both yoga is not merely an exercise how to mount on the journey of life with the inter play of body mind thoughts and behavior can be better realized and understood through yoga just two days back i have written letters to all governments and all leaders of the world about the yoga day last year i made announcements of some yoga competitions and some awards as well we shall gradually advance in that direction i have received one suggestion and i compliment the gentleman who has made this creative suggestion it is a very interesting suggestion he has said since this is the third international yoga day i should make an appeal that on this third international yoga day three generations of the family should do yoga together grand parents parents and children should together perform yoga and also upload their photos it will be such pleasant blend of yesterday today and tomorrow that it will lend a new dimension to yoga i express my gratitude for this suggestion and i feel that as our selfie with daughter campaign had proved to be a very inspiring experience so will this campaign of posting pictures of three generations together performing yoga will evoke curiosity across the nation as well as across the world you should certainly send the pictures of three generations doing yoga together to me on narendra modiapp or on mygov this will be the picture of yesterday today and tomorrow and will be a guarantee of a brighter tomorrow i invite all of you we are still left with about three weeks for the international yoga day start practicing from today itself from 1st june i will post something or the other about yoga on twitter and continue to do so till 21st june i will share with you you too kindly spread the message of yoga and connect people with it this in a way is a movement on preventive health care i invite you all to get connected to it ever since you entrusted me with the responsibility of being the pradhan sewak the chief servant of the people and when for the first time when i got a chance to address from the ramparts of red fort on 15th august i had talked of cleanliness from then onwards i get a chance to stay in different parts of the country and i have seen that people closely follow as to what modi does where does modi go what all has modi done i received a very interesting phone call and i had also not visualized from this angle but i am thankful to him for having seen the campaign in this way this phone call will also attract your attention pranam modi ji i m naina from mumbai modi ji i watch whether on tv or social media wherever you go one can see people in that city pay special attention to cleanliness mumbai or surat your clarion call has led people to adopt cleanliness as a mission not only the elders but children also have become aware about cleanliness many a time we see them telling elders not to litter on the roads the cleanliness drive that you had begun from the ghats or banks of the ganges in kashi has now taken the shape of a movement inspired by you you are right that wherever i go the government machinery does the cleaning but nowadays cleanliness also turns into a social event five seven or ten days before my visit a large number of cleanliness drives are held media also prominently highlights such programmes a few days ago i went to kutch in gujarat a big cleanliness drive was conducted there i also did not see a connect is in this but after receiving this phone call i also started thinking that the point made there was pertinent you can very well imagine how much pleasure i derive by knowing this fact and also by noticing that the country is also closely monitoring the programme there cannot be any bigger pleasure for me than to know that my visit has been connected with the cleanliness campaign besides usual arrangements to welcome the prime minister cleanliness will also be high on the agenda this is very pleasing and inspiring for any cleanliness loving person i congratulate everyone connected with this cleanliness programme providing strength to it someone gave me a suggestion this is in a way a humorous suggestion i do not know whether i would be able to do it or not modi ji when someone asks for your visit your stay you should ask as to what would be the standard of cleanliness if they wish to invite you how many tonnes of waste would you present to me so that i may accordingly decide the duration of stay the idea is very good but i will have to think but one thing is right that this movement should be encouraged and it would definitely be better if cleaning tonnes of waste are cleaned and and given as presents in place of other gifts how many people shall we be able to save from ill health this will be a big service to humanity one thing i would certainly like to say is that we should always consider these waste as resources and wealth do not see it as just garbage once we start looking at garbage and waste as a wealth we shall also find newer techniques of waste management young persons connected with start ups will also come forward with newer schemes and also come forward with new equipments the central government has along with state governments and with the cooperation of municipal representatives of cities decided to launch a massive and important campaign of waste management on the occasion of world environment day on 5th june there are going to be litter bins made available to collect solid waste and liquid waste in 4000 towns of the country two types of waste bins will be available one would be of green colour and the other blue there are two types of waste generated is the liquid waste and the other is dry waste if we follow discipline then the waste bins that are going to be placed in these 4 thousand towns will collect dry garbage in blue waste bins and liquid garbage in green waste bins the waste from our kitchens be it vegetable peels leftover food egg shells or leaves are all part of liquid waste and are to be placed in green litter bins this waste can be utilized in fields and if you will remember that fields are green then you will remember what to place in the green litter bins the second type of waste is like old newspapers cardboard iron glass cloth plastic leather polythene broken boxes rubber metals and other kind of waste are all dry waste or litter which can be recycled by machines but cannot be directly used and has to be placed in the blue waste bin i ve a firm belief that we will develop a culture and the new steps that we take towards achieving cleanliness will continue only then will we achieve the dream of gandhiji achieve the kind of cleanliness that he dreamt of today i must admit with pride that if a single individual decides it in his heart then a huge public campaign can be launched cleanliness is also one such drive a few days ago you must have heard that the versova beach in mumbai which was infamous for its filth has now transformed into a a clean and beautiful beach people toiled for about 80 90 weeks unceasingly and turned versova beach around by extracting thousand of tonnes of waste materials and today versova beach is clean and beautiful this campaign was owned by versova residence volunteer or vrv a gentleman called afroz shah started this mission from october 2015 whole heartedly with all his might slowly people started joining his bandwagon and turned into a people s movement for this outstanding work united nations environment programme or unep awarded champion of the earth award to sh afroz shah and thus he has become the first indian to achieve this distinction i congratulate sh afroz shah and felicitate this people s movement the manner in which sh afroz shah gathered the people of the area into a people s collective and gave it the shape of a people s movement in itself an inspiring example brothers and sisters it is with great happiness that i wish to tell you that i am given to understand that under the aegis of swachch bharat campaign the riyasi block in jammu and kashmir has become completely free of open defecation i wish to congratulate the people of riyasi block and also the public servants of riyasi block jammu kashmir has presented an excellent example i congratulate one and all in the state i have been told that this movement found maximum leadership amidst women the women of that area took out torch rallies to spread awareness went from house to house street to street and inspired the people towards this goal i felicitate the mothers and sisters of riyasi from the bottom of my heart i also congratulate the administrators there for making an excellent beginning by turning one block in the state of jammu and kashmir open defecation free my dear countrymen an audit and assessment of the performance of the present government in the last three years is happening all over on newspapers social media or tv for the last 15 days three years ago you vested the responsibility of pradhan sewak the chief servant of the people upon me there have been many surveys and several opinion polls i see this entire process as a very healthy sign the works done during these years were tested on every touch stone it was analyzed by every segment of society and this is a great process in democracy i firmly believe that governments must be accountable in democracy and the public at large must be provided with report card of works done i wish to congratulate those who took out time for an in depth analysis of our work there were some praises some support and sometimes shortcomings were also pointed out i understand the importance of all these things i thank those people who provided critical and important feedback the mistakes and the shortcomings once highlighted can be rectified whether something is good little less effective or bad whatever it is one has to learn from it and move ahead in life putting the learning from it into practice constructive criticism strengthens democracy for an aware nation an awakened nation this churning is very important my dear countrymen i too am an ordinary citizen like you and like any ordinary citizen i too am influenced by good or bad things some people take mann ki baat as a monologue and some criticize it from a political angle but after a long experience i now feel that when i had first started mann ki baat i had not given thought to the fact that mann ki baat would make me a member of every family in india now i feel as if i m conversing with my family while sitting at home and there are many families who have written to me these very feelings and as i said as an ordinary citizen i too get affected emotionally two days ago there was a launch of an analytical book on mann ki baat at rashtrapati bhavan it was attended by the hon ble president hon ble vice president madam speaker of the lok sabha and as an ordinary citizen and as an individual this was very inspirational event for me i m grateful to the hon ble president hon ble vice president and madam speaker that inspite of their such high stature they took out time and they accorded importance to mann ki baat in fact it in itself has given a new dimension to mann ki baat some of our friends while working on this book had discussed it with me also and some time ago i was pleasantly surprised when this book was in the news again because akbar sahab an artist living in abu dhabi proposed that he wishes to sketch the topics on which various episodes of mann ki baat were based and without taking a single rupee akbar sahab transformed mann ki baat into art as a gesture of his love i am grateful to akbar sahab my dear countrymen when we shall meet next time by then monsoon rains would be lashing every corner of the country the weather would have changed examination results would have arrived the journey of education will begin anew and the rains would bring a hope pleasant fragrance a new aroma come let us move ahead while loving nature

thread be it sanitation personnel brothers and sisters or veterans from myriad sectors mann ki baat has striven to bring everyone together the intimacy and affection that all of you have shown for mann ki baat is unprecedented it makes one emotional when mann ki baat was broadcast in different countries of the world in various time zones somewhere it was evening and somewhere it was late night despite that a large number of people took time out to listen to the 100th episode i also saw that video from new zealand thousands of miles away in which a 100 year old is expressing her motherly blessings people from india and abroad have expressed their views on mann ki baat many people have also offered constructive analysis people have appreciated the fact that in mann ki baat only the achievements of the country and the countrymen are discussed i once again thank you all with all due respects for this blessing my dear countrymen we talked about the kashi tamil sangamam saurashtra tamil sangamam in mann ki baat kashi telugu sangamam was also held a while ago in varanasi another such unique effort to give strength to the spirit of ek bharat shrestha bharat has taken place in the country this is the effort of the yuva sangam i thought why not ask about this in detail from the very people who have been a part of this unique effort that s why two young people are connected with me on the phone right now one is gyamarnyokum ji from arunachal pradesh and the other is daughter vishakha singh ji from bihar let us first talk to gyamarnyokum prime minister gyamar ji namaste gyamar ji namaste modi ji prime minister fine gyamar ji first of all i would like toknow about you gyamar ji modi ji first of all i express my gratitude to you and the government of india that you gave me an

you go for the yuva sangam how did you go what happened gyamar ji modi ji our institution nit told us about the yuva sangam and that we couldparticipate in it i again searched a little on the internet and i came to know that this is a very good program which could enable one to contribute a lot in the vision of ek bharat shreshtha bharat and i will get a chance to learn something new i then right away enrolled in it by going to the website my experience was very enjoyable very good prime minister did you have to make any selection gyamar ji modi ji when i opened the website the people of arunachal had two options first was andhra pradesh which had iit tirupati and the second was central university rajasthan so i put in my first preference as rajasthan second preference i did iit tirupati i got selected for rajasthan hence i went to rajasthan prime minister how was your rajasthan visit did you go torajasthan for the first time gyamar ji yes i had gone out of arunachal for the first time i had seen all these forts of rajasthan only in films and on the phone so when i went for the first time my experience was very good the people there were very good and the treatment given to us was very good i got to learn many new things about the big lakes of rajasthan and the people there and rain water harvesting as well which i did not know at all so this rajasthan visit was very good for me prime minister see the biggest advantage you have got is thatarunachal is also a land of brave hearts rajasthan is also a land of brave hearts and there are a large number of people from rajasthan in the army and whenever you meet people from rajasthan among the soldiers on the border in arunachal you can definitely speak with them that you had gone to rajasthan had such an experience after that your closeness with them will increase instantly well you must have noticed some similarities there too you would have thought that yes it is the same in arunachal too gyamar ji modi ji the one similarity i found was the love for the country and the vision and feeling of ek bharat shreshtha bharat because in arunachal too people feel very proud that they are indians and similarly in rajasthan also people are proud of their mother land i noticed this a lot and especially in the young generation because i interacted with many youths there so i saw a lot of similarity with what they want and that is whatever you want to do for india and love for your country i saw a lot of similarity in both the states prime minister so did you increase your level of interaction with the friends that you made there or forgot them after returning gyamar ji no we extended our introduction prime minister yes so are you active on social media gyamar ji yes modi ji i am active prime minister then you should write a blogon your experiences in the yuva sangam how you enrolled in it how your experience in rajasthan has been so that the youth of the country know the signigficance and greatness of ek bharat shreshtha bharat what this schemeis all about how youths can take advantage of it you should write a blog full of your experiences then it will be useful for many people to read gyamar ji yes i certainly will do prime minister gyamar ji it was a pleasure talking to you and all of you youth should strive for the country s bright future because these 25 years are very important for your life as well as for the life of the country i extend my best wishes to you thank you gyamar ji thank you modi ji to you too prime minister namaskar brother friends the people of arunachal are so full of warmth that i enjoy talking to them gyamarji s experience at the yuva sangam was excellent come let s now speak to daughter from bihar vishakha singh ji prime minister vishakha ji namaskar vishakha ji first of all my pranam to honorable prime minister of india and along with it many salutations to you on behalf of all the delegates prime minister wellvishakha ji first tell us about yourself then i also want to know about the yuva sangam vishakha ji i am a resident of sasaram city of bihar and i came to know about yuva sangam first through a message of my college whatsapp group so after that i found out more details about it exactly what it is so i came to know that this is a coming together of the youth through prime minister s scheme ek bharat shreshtha bharat so after that i applied and when i applied i was excited to join it but after traveling from there to tamil nadu and back with the exposure that i gained i now feel very proud that i have been a part of this program so i am very happy to have participated in that program and i express my gratitude to you from the core of my heart that you have made such a wonderful program for youths like us so that we can adapt to the culture of different regions of india prime minister vishakha ji what do you study vishakha ji i am a second year student of computer science engineering prime minister ok vishakha ji how did you decide on the choice of the state you would go to and get connected with vishakha ji when i started searching about this yuva sangam on google i came to know that delegates from bihar were being exchanged with delegates from tamil nadu tamil nadu is a very rich cultural state of our country so even at that time when i came to know and saw that people from bihar were being sent to tamil nadu it also helped me a lot in taking the decision that i should fill the form and whether to go there or not i really feel very proud today that i took part in it and i am very happy prime minister was it your first visit to tamil nadu vishakha ji ji i d gone for the first time prime minister well if you want to say something specially memorable what would you say the youth of the country are listening to you vishakha ji yes if we consider the whole journey it has been wonderful for me we have learnt very good things at each stage i have made good friends in tamil nadu have adapted to the culture there i met people there but the best thing that struck me there was that firstly no one gets a chance to go to isro and we being delegates got this opportunity to go to isro plus the second best thing was when we went to raj bhavan and met the governor of tamil nadu so those two moments were very good for me and i feel that in the age in which we are as a youth we do not get the opportunity that we got through the yuva sangam so it was perfect and most memorable moment for me prime minister in bihar food habits are different from the way they are in tamilnadu visakha ji yes prime minister so it got set completely vishakha ji south indian cuisine is prevalent in tamilnadu so as soon as we went there we were served dosa idli sambhar uttapam vada upma so first when we tried it was too good the food there is very healthy in fact it is very delicious and it is very different from the food of our north so i liked the food there and the people there were also very nice prime minister so now you must have made friends in tamil nadu too vishakha ji yes yes there we stayed at nit trichy after that at iit madras i have become friends with the students at both those places plus there was a cii welcome ceremony meanwhile so many students from nearby colleges also came there so there we interacted with those students as well and i felt very happy to meet them many of them are my friends too and i also met some delegates who were coming to bihar from tamil nadu so we had a conversation with them as well and we still talk to each other so i feel very happy prime minister so vishakha ji do write a blog and share this experience on social media firstly of this yuva sangam then of ek bharat shreshth bharat and then the warmth you felt in tamil nadu and the welcome and hospitality that you received you were showered with the the love of tamil people tell all these things to the country so will you write vishakha ji yes of course prime minister so i wish you all the best and thank you very much visakha ji ji thank you so much namaskar my best wishes to you gyamar and vishakha may what you have learntat the yuva sangam stay with you for the rest of your life this is my best wish for all of you friends india s strength lies in its diversity there is a lot to see in our country keeping this in view the ministry of education has taken an excellent initiative named yuvasangam the objective of this initiative is to increase people to people connect as well as to give an opportunity to the youth of the country to mingle with each other higher educational

towards water conservation friends we keep talking about the challenges related to water every summer this time also we will take up this topic but this time we will discuss the start ups related to water conservation there is a start up fluxgen this start up provides water management options through i o t enabled technologies this technology will tell us about the patterns of water usage and will help in effective use of water another startup is livnsense this is a platform based on artificial intelligence and machine learning with its help effective monitoring of water distribution can be done from this it will also be ascertained where and how much water is being wasted another start up is kumbhikagaz this kumbhikagaz is a topic i am sure you will like very much kumbhikagaz start up has embarked upon a special task they are working on making paper from water hyacinth that is water hyacinth which was once considered a problem for water sources is now being used to make paper friends if many youths are working through innovation and technology there are many youths who are also engaged in the mission of making the society aware like the youth of balod district in chhattisgarh the youth here have started a campaign to save water they go door to door to make people aware of water conservation if there is an event like marriage somewhere this group of youth goes there and gives information about how misuse of water can be stopped an inspiring effort related to the efficient use of water is also being undertaken in khunti district of jharkhand people in khunti have found a way out of the water crisis through check dams due to accumulation of water from the check dams greens and vegetables have also started growing here on account of this the income of the people is also increasing and the needs of the region are also being fulfilled khunti has become a fascinating example of how any public participation effort brings with it many changes i congratulate the people there for this endeavour my dear countrymen during the 1965 war our former prime minister lal bahadur shastri had given the slogan of jai jawan jai kisan later atal ji had also added jai vigyan to it a few years ago while talking to the scientists of the country i talked about jai anusandhan in mann ki baat today s reference is about such a person about such an organization which is a reflection of all these four jai jawan jai kisan jai vigyan and jai anusandhan this is a gentleman shriman shivaji shamrao dole from maharashtra shivaji dole hails from a small village in nashik district he comes from a poor tribal farmer family and is also an ex serviceman while in the army he dedicated his life to the country after retirement he decided to learn something new and did a diploma in agriculture that is he moved towards jai jawan jai kisan now every moment he strives to ensure how to contribute maximum in the agriculture sector in this campaign shivaji dole ji formed a small team of 20 people and added some ex servicemen to it after this his team took over the management of a co operative organization named venkateshwara co operative power agro processing limited this co operative organization was lying dormant which he took up the challenge of reviving today venkateshwara co operative has expanded to many districts in no time today this team is working in maharashtra and karnataka about 18 000 people are associated with it in which a large number of our ex servicemen are also there the members of this team are doing agro farming in more than 500 acres of land in malegaon nashik this team is also engaged in building many ponds for water conservation the special thing is that they have also started organic farming and dairy now grapes grown there are

many young people students as well i really feel good for the fact that this mann ki baat family of ours is continually growing connecting with hearts and connecting through goals too and our ever deepening bonds are creating a surge of a flow of constant positivity within us my dear countrymen ojaswi from sitapur has written to me that he enjoys discussions touching upon the amrit mahotsav a lot he listens to mann ki baat with his friends and is continuously trying to know and learn more about the freedom struggle friends the amrit mahotsav along with learning also inspires us to do something for the country and now throughout the country whether it s common folk or governments from panchayats to parliament the resonance of the amrit mahotsav is palpable programmes in connection with the mahotsav are going on successively one such interesting programme was held in delhi recently in the programme azadi ki kahani bachchon ki zubani children narrated stories connected with the freedom struggle from the core of their hearts the special element in that was along with india students from nepal mauritius tanzania new zealand and fiji too participated in that activity our country s maharatna ongc too is celebrating the amrit mahotsav in a slightly different manner these days ongc is organizing study tours to oil fields for our students in these tours youth are being imparted knowledge on ongc s oil field operations with the objective that our budding engineers be able to contribute their bit to nation building efforts with full zest and fervor friends keeping in view the contribution of our tribal communities in attaining freedom the country has also celebrated the janajati gaurav saptah across different regions of the country programmes related to that were held in the andaman nicobar archipelago people from tribal communities such as jarwa and onge vibrantly displayed their culture miniature writer ram kumar joshi ji from una himachal pradesh too has

biography of both the great men has been inscribed some friends from katni madhya pradesh have conveyed information on a memorable dastangoi story telling programme in that memories of the indomitable courage and sacrifice of rani durgavati have been rekindled one such programme took place in kashi a three day festival was organized in honour of illustrious luminaries such as goswami tulsidas sant kabir sant ravidas bharatendu harishchandra munshi premchand and jaishankar prasad in different periods all of them played a major role in fostering public awakening in the country you might be aware in the last episodes of mann ki baat i had referred to three competitions one was on writing patriotic songs one on drawing rangolis on events connected with patriotic fervor and the freedom movement and one on scripting lullabies that nurture dreams of a grand india in the minds of our children i hope that you certainly must have sent in your entries too for these competitions you must have made plans as well you must have discussed it among friends too i hope you will promote this programme in every corner of india with wholehearted enthusiasm my dear countrymen in this discussion i now straightaway take you to vrindavan it is said about vrindavan that it is a tangible manifestation of god s love our saints too have remarked yeh aasa dhari chitta mein yeh aasa dhari chitta mein kahat jathaa mati mor vrindavan sukh rang kau vrindavan sukh rang kau kaahu na payau aur meaning we all refer to the glory of vrindavan according to our own capabilities but the inner joy of vrindavan its inherent spirit nobody can attain it in its entirety it is infinite that is exactly why vrindavan has been attracting people from all over the world you will find its mark in every corner of the world there is a city in western australia perth cricket lovers must be well acquainted with the place since cricket matches are often held there in perth there is an art gallery called sacred india gallery this gallery has been set up in the beautiful region of swan valley and it is the result of the efforts of a resident of australia jagat tarini dasi ji jagat tarini ji is actually an australian born and brought up there but she came to vrindavan and spent more than 13 years here she says that though she returned to australia came back to her own country but she could never forget vrindavan that s why in order to stay spiritually connected with vrindavan she created vrindavan in australia itself making her art a medium she set up a marvelous vrindavan people who come here get an opportunity to view myriad artefacts they get to see glimpses of the most famous pilgrimage centres of india the traditions and culture of vrindavan navaadweep and jagannathpuri here many an artwork related to the life of bhagwan shrikrishna has been exhibited there is an artifact as well that displays the govardhan parvat held aloft by bhagwan shrikrishna on his little finger with people of vrindavan taking refuge beneath indeed this matchless endeavour on part of jagat tarini ji brings to the fore the power of krishna bhakti i extend my best wishes on this effort of hers my dear countrymen i was just referring to the subject of vrindavan built at perth australia there s an interesting history as well in that australia shares a bond with our jhansi bundelkhand actually when the queen of jhansi laxmibai was fighting a legal battle against the east india company her lawyer was john lang john lang was originally a resident of australia staying in india he fought rani laxmibai s case all of us know of the huge contribution of jhansi and bundelkhand in our fight for freedom veeranganas brave hearts such as rani laxmibai and jhalkaribai hailed from here this region has given to the country legendary sports persons like major dhyanchand too friends it is not necessary that bravery should be displayed only on the battlefield when bravery becomes a vow and it expands then many feats start getting accomplished in every field mrs jyotsna has written a letter to me about very such valor there was a traditional river in jalaun noon river noon used to be the main source of water for the farmers here but gradually the noon river reached the verge of extinction the little existence that was left of this river in that it was turning into a drain due to this problems in irrigation had also arisen for the farmers the people of jalaun took the initiative to change this situation this very year in march a committee was formed for this thousands of villagers and local people spontaneously volunteered to join this campaign the panchayats here started working together with the villagers and today in such a short time and at a very low cost the river has come back to life again so many farmers are benefiting from this apart from the battlefield this example of bravery shows the determination of our countrymen and it also tells that if we take a resolve nothing is impossible and that is why i say sabka prayas everyone s effort my dear countrymen when we conserve nature in return nature also gives us protection and security we experience this in our personal life as well and one such example has been presented by the people of tamil nadu on a large scale this is the example of thoothukudi district of tamil nadu we know that coastal areas are many a time prone to land submersion there were many such small islands and islets in thoothukudi too which were increasingly in danger of submerging in the sea the people here and the experts found the mitigation from this natural disaster through nature itself these people are now planting palmyra trees on these islands these trees stand firm even in cyclones and storms and give protection to the soil through this now a new confidence has arisen in saving this area friends nature poses a threat to us only when we disturb her balance or destroy her sanctity nature nurtures us like a mother and fills our world with vivid colors too i have been watching on social media the picture of a flying boat in meghalaya that is becoming viral this picture catches our attention at the very first sight itself most of you must have certainly seen it online when we look closely at this boat floating in the air we come to know that it is moving on the river water the water of the river is so clear that we can see its bed and the boat seems to be floating in the air there are many states in our country there are many areas where people have preserved the colors of their natural heritage these people have kept the lifestyle of living in harmony with nature alive even today this is an inspiration to all of us too whatever natural resources are around us we should save them bring them back to their actual form in this lies the interests of all of us interests of the world my dear countrymen when the government makes plans spends the budget completes the projects on time people feel that it is working but in the many works of the government amidst the many schemes of development things related to human sensitivities always give a different kind of joy with the efforts of the government with the schemes of the government the way a life changed what is the experience of that changed life when we hear this we too are filled with empathy it also gives satisfaction to the mind and gives inspiration too to take that scheme to the people in a way it is just swant sukhay joy to one s own soul and that is why today in mann ki baat two such friends are also joining us who have won a new life through their zeal they got their treatment done with the help of ayushman bharat scheme and have started a new life our first friend is rajesh kumar prajapati who had an ailment of the heart heart disease so let s talk to rajesh ji prime minister rajesh ji namaste rajesh prajapati namaste sir namaste prime minister what was your disease rajesh ji you must have gone to some doctor just

photograph of sardar patel on the cover page of that edition in their lead story they had depicted a map of india it was nowhere close to what the map looks like now it was the map of an india that was divided into myriad fragments there existed over 550 princely states the english had lost interest in india they wanted to leave india fragmented into pieces time magazine had opined that hovering over india then were the dangers of problems like partition violence food scarcity price rise and power politics the magazine further observed that amidst that plethora of problems if there was anyone who possessed the capability to unite the country and heal wounds it was sardarvallabhbhai patel the story also brings to the fore other aspects of the life of the iron man of india the manner in which he had managed relief operations during the ahmedabad floods in the 1920s the way he steered the bardolisatyagrah such was his sense of honesty commitment that the farmer the worker right up to the industrialist trusted him with full faith gandhiji considered sardar patel as the only one capable of finding a lasting solution to the vexed issue of the states and asked him to act sardar patel formulated solutions one by one weaving the warp weft of unity on the axis of a single thread he ensured the merger of all princely states with the dominion of india whether junagadh hyderabad travancore or for that matter the princely states of rajasthan if we are able to see a united india now it was entirely on account of the sagacity strategic wisdom of sardar patel it is but natural

view to motivating their employees for social activities and providing them with opportunities to perform in this field their dedication and vigour can make each indian feel proud a fresh and pleasant air of it to society we not i a transformation from the individual to the community is imbibed in this someone is teaching the old people someone is involved in the campaign of cleanliness whereas someone is helping out the farmers and there is no vested interest behind all these activities but a pure feeling of dedication and resolve is the driving force one young person learned to play wheelchair basket ball in order to be able to help the wheelchair basket ball team of differently abled divyang players this spirit this dedication is a mission mode activity will this not make every indian feel proud this spirit of we not i will surely inspire all of us my dear brothers and sisters when i was going through your suggestion for mann ki baat this time i found a very interesting comment from shri manish mahapatra from pudducherry he wrote on mygov please take up the topic in mann ki baat as to how the tribes and their traditions and rituals are the best examples of coexistence with the nature how do we need to adopt their traditions in our lives for achieving sustainable development and learn from those traditions manishji i appreciate you for bringing this subject among the listeners of mann ki baat this is one subject that inspires us to look into our dignified past and our ancient traditions today the whole world and specially the western countries are discussing about environment protection and are trying to find new ways to adopt a balanced life style our country is also facing this problem but for its solution we only have to look inwards to look into our glorious past and our rich traditions and have especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities to live in consonance and closed coordination with the nature has been an integral part of our tribal communities our tribal brethren worship trees and plants and flowers like gods and goddesses the bhil tribes of central india and specially those in madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh worship peepal and arjun trees religiously thebishnoi community in the desert land of rajasthan has shown us a way of environment protection specially in the context of serving trees they prefer laying down their lives but cannot tolerate any harm to a single tree mishmi tribes of arunachal pradesh claim their relationship with tigers they even treat them like their brothers and sisters in nagaland as well tigers are seen as the forest guardians people of warli community in maharashtra consider tigers as their guests and for them the presence of tigers is a good omen indicating prosperity there is a belief among the kol community in central india that their fortune is directly connected with the tigers and they firmly believe that if the tigers do not get food the villagers will have to facehunger the gond tribes in central indai stop fishing in some parts of kaithan river during the breeding season they consider this area as a fish reserve and they get plentiful of healthy fishes because of this belief of theirs tribal communities make their dwelling units from natural material which are strong as well as eco friendly in the isolated regions of the nilgiri plateau in south india a small wanderer community toda make their settlements using locally available material only my dear brothers and sisters this is a fact that the tribal community believes in very peaceful and harmonious co existence but if somebody tries to harm and cause damage to their natural resources they do not shy away from fighting for their rights there is no wonder that our foremost freedom fighters were the brave people from our tribal communities who can forget bhagwanbirsamunda who struggled hard against the british empire to save their own forest land besides whatever i have said there is a very long list of examples of the tribal communities which teach us how to keep a close coordination and make adjustments with the nature and the nation is indebted to our tribal people for the forest land that is still remaining with us come on let us express our gratitude towards them my dear countrymen in mann ki baat we talk about those persons and institutions who make extra ordinary contribution for the society these works may seem small but have a very deep impact in changing our thinking and in giving a new direction to the society a few days ago i was reading about a farmer brother gurbachan singh from punjab the son of this hard working farmer gurbachan singh ji was to be married gurbachan singh ji had told the bride s parents that the marriage would be performed in a solemn manner there is absolutely no need to spend much on wedding reception or any other item we have to keep it a very very simple event but then he suddenly said that he had one condition and when a condition is put these days generally it is thought that the other side is going to make a big demand which will be really difficult for the bride s family to fulfill but you will be surprised to know that bhai gurbachan singh was a simple farmer and what he told the bride s father and the condition he placed reflects the true strength of our society gurbachan singh ji asked him to promise that they will not burn parali or stubble in their fields you can well imagine the social strength this statement had this point made by gurbachan singh ji appears quite ordinary but this reveals how tall and strong his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society who connect their individual matters with the benefit of the society as a whole shrimangurbachan singh ji s family has presented one such example before us i have also read about a village kallarmajra which is near nabha in punjab kallarmajra came into lime light as the farmers there mix the stubble with the sand by ploughing their fields rather than burning the stubble and adopt the necessary technology for the process congratulations to bhaigurbachan singh ji congratulations to the people of kallarmajra and of all those places who are making their best efforts to keep the environment clean and pollution free all of you are carrying forward the indian tradition of a healthy life style as a true successor just as a sea is formed by collection of tiny drops similarly a small constructive step plays a vital role in creating a positive environment my dear countrymen it has been told in our epics it means o lord peace should prevail all around in all three lokas in water in air in space in fire in wind in medicines in vegetation in

important event rightly speaking we had no direct connection with that war despite this our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made the supreme sacrifice indian soldiers showed it to the world that they are second to none if it comes to war our soldiers have displayed great valour in difficult areas and adverse conditions there has just been a single objective behind it restoration of peace the world witnessed a dance of death and devastation during the world war i according to estimates around one crore soldiers and almost the same number of civilians lost their lives this made the whole world realize and understand the importance of peace the definition of peace has changed in the last hundred years today peace does not only mean no war there is a need to work unitedly to address issues such as terrorism climate change economic development to social justice through universal cooperation and co ordination development of the poorest of the poor is the real indicator of peace my dear countrymen our north east has a unique distinction of its own the natural beauty of north east has no parallel and the people of this area are extremely talented now

working in a dedicated manner to help in educating the poor children this group of youngsters has started a big campaign in delhi for providing education to the street children and slum dwellers initially shocked to see the condition of children begging around or doing some menial jobs that this group of youngsters got dedicatedly selflessly involved into this creative mission starting with just 15 children from the slums near geeta colony in new delhi it is now being run at 12 places and two thousand children have been brought under its fold young teachers associated with this campaign find out a free time of two hours from their busy schedule and contribute in this stupendous mission of bringing out a social transformation dear brothers and sisters in this very way some farmers from hilly areas of uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers across the country with their collective efforts they have not only changed their own fortunes but have changed fortunes of the whole region in bageshwar in uttarakhand main crops sown are mandwa chaulai corn or barley this being a hilly area the farmers did not get a fair price of their produce but the farmers in kapkot tehsil decided to come out of this situation and adopted a value addition process and changed the loss incurring equation into a profit earning one what they did was that they started production of biscuits from their agricultural produce and sold those biscuits directly in the market consequently chaulai which the farmers were forced to sell at rs 25 per kg was now selling at rs 50 per kg as biscuits besides there is a strong belief that the land in this area is iron rich and these iron rich biscuits are very good for pregnant women as they overcome the deficiency of iron these farmers have formed a cooperative society in munar village and set up a biscuit factory there impressed by the bold initiative of these farmers the administration has also linked this to the national livelihood mission these biscuits are now being supplied upto almora and kousani besides being sold to about fifty aanganwadi kendras in bagheshwar district with the hard work of these farmers the annual turnover of the society has gone up from 10 to 15 lakh rupees and with more than 900 families getting employment here people have stopped migrating to other places my dear countrymen we often hear that in times to come the world will face a war because of water everyone talks about this but do we not have any responsibility towards conservation of water do we not feel that water conservation must be a social responsibility this must be a collective responsibility how can we conserve each single drop of rain water and we all know this and water conservation is not a new topic for us it is neither a part of the academic curriculum nor a part of our languages our forefathers have lived this as a way of life for centuries together they gave due priority and importance to each single drop of water they found out newer methods in order to conserve every single drop of water those of you who might be getting a chance to visit tamilnadu might have noticed that in some temples in the state there are carvings on stone depicting irrigation system water conservation methods and drought management there are vast stone inscriptions in these temples and devotees get a chance to read these educative messages may it be mannarkovil chiran mahadevi kovilpatti or pudukottai you will get to see massive stone inscriptions to this effect several baodis stepwells are famous as tourist spots but please do not forget that these are the living symbols of the water conservation campaigns which our forefathers had accomplished adalaj and patan ki raniki vaav baodi in gujarat is a unesco world heritage site and its grandeur is to be seen to be believed baodis are water temples in a way if you happen to go to rajasthan you must visit chand baodi this is one of the biggest and the most beautiful baodis of india and the point to be noted is that this is situated in a water scarce area april may june and july is the most suitable time when rain water harvesting can be done and if we make preparations in advance we can reap a rich harvest budget under mnrega is also utilized for this water conservation activity during the last three years everyone in his or her own way has contributed towards water conservation and water management an average of 32 000 crore rupees have been spent besides the mnrega budget each year on water conservation and water management if we talk of 2017 18 55 percent of the total outlay of rupees 64 thousand crores which comes to around rupees 35 thousand crores has been spent on works like water conservation in last three years nearly 150 lakh hectares of land got more benefit through water conservation and water management measures some people have really benefitted very well from mnrega budget provisions made by the government of india for water conservation and water management works a project of reviving the rivers which had dried out was undertaken in kerala seven thousand workers under mnrega worked very hard for seventy days and finally succeeded in reviving kuttumperoor river there the ganges and the yamuna have plentiful of water but there are many other places in uttar pradesh like fatehpur district where two small rivers namely sasur khaderi got dried out after receiving the reports of remote sensing imagery and inter department coordination the district administration took up the responsibility of soil and water conservation on a massive scale they succeeded in reviving the dried out sasur khaderi river with the help and cooperation of people from 40 45 villages of the area this grand achievement is a big boon for animals birds farmers crops and villages i emphasis that once again april may june and july are before us and we must also take up some responsibility for water harvesting and water conservation we should also chalk out some schemes we should also do and show something my dear countrymen when mann ki baat approaches i receive messages letters and phone calls from all sides aayan kumar banerjee from devi tola village of north 24 parganas in west bengal in his comment on my gov has written we celebrate rabindra jayanti every year but many people are not aware of the nobel laureate rabindra nath s philosophy of living peacefully aesthetically and with integrity kindly discuss this point in mann ki baat programme so that more and more people may get to know about this i thank aayanji for drawing the attention of all listeners of mann ki baat towards this point gurudev tagore was a personality full of knowledge and intellect whose writings left an indelible mark on everyone rabindra nath was a personality full of talent a multi directional personna but a teacher in his inner self can always be felt he has written in gitanjali he who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students i do not know bangla but had the habit of rising early since my childhood and in eastern india radio broadcasts start early while in western india these start a bit late i have a faint memory that probably around 5 30 in the morning rabindra sangeet used to be broadcast on radio and i had developed a habit to listen to rabindra sangeet on radio and whenever i got a chance to listen to poems like anandloke and aaguner poroshmoni i used to feel as if my mind was being energised you must also have been impressed by rabindra sangeet and his poems i pay my respectful homage to rabindra nath tagore my dear countrymen within a few days from now the holy month of ramazan will dawn upon us the month of ramazan is celebrated with full reverence and respect throughout the world the sociological and collective aspect of fasting is that when a person experiences hunger himself he comes to realize the hunger of others when he is thirsty he realizes the thirst of others this is an opportunity to remember the teachings of prophet muhammad peace be upon him and his message it is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood as morals from his life once a person asked the prophet peace be upon him which is the best thing in islam the prophet saab said feeding a poor and needy and meeting everyone cordially whether you know him or not prophet mohammad sahib peace be upon him believed in twin principles of knowledge and compassion he did not possess an iota of ego regarding himself he preached that knowledge alone defeats ego prophet mohammad sahib peace be upon him believed that if you possessed anything more than your requirement then donate it to the needy thus donation or giving alms is important during ramzan people donate generously to the needy during this holy month prophet muhammad sahib believed that a person is rich because of his inherent spirituality and not materialistic wealth i wish all the citizens an auspicious month of ramazan and i hope this opportunity will inspire people to follow the prophet s message of peace and goodwill my dear countrymen buddha purnima is a special day for every indian we must be proud of the fact that india is the birthplace of lord buddha the very synonym of power of compassion service and sacrifice who guided millions of people around the world this buddha purnima reminds us of all of our obligation to emulate lord buddha s teaching as well as pledge ourselves to follow his footsteps lord buddha was the fountainhead of egalitarianism peace harmony and brotherhood these are human values which are most desired in the world today baba saheb dr ambedkar stressed that lord buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy baba saheb had said my social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words liberty equality and fraternity my philosophy has roots in religion and not in political science i have derived them from the teaching of my master the buddha baba saheb strengthened the oppressed exploited deprived and crores of people standing on the brink of marginalization via the constitution of india there cannot be a bigger example of compassion than this this form of compassion was one of the greatest qualities of lord buddha for the alleviation of suffering of the people the buddhist monks used to travel to different countries carrying with them the rich ideals of lord buddha and this has been occurring throughout the ages we have inherited the wisdom of lord buddha throughout asia as part of our legacy it forges a link between us and many asian countries like china japan korea thailand cambodia and myanmar where buddhist traditions and his preaching are a part of their origins and this is the very reason that we are developing infrastructure for buddhist tourism which is going to connect southeast asia with the important buddhist sites of india i am also very pleased that the government of india is a partner in the restoration of many buddhist temples which also includes the centuries old magnificent anand temple in bagan in myanmar today when there is confrontation and human suffering prevalent everywhere in the world lord buddha s teachings show the way to rid hatred from the world with compassion i wish people spread all over the world who revere lord buddha and believe in the principles of compassion i wish all of them an auspicious buddha purnima i seek benediction from lord buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfill our responsibility in building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings today as we remember lord buddha you must have heard about the idols of laughing buddha it is said that laughing buddha brings one good fortune but very few people know that smiling buddha is also associated with an important event in india s defense history now you will be wondering what is the connection between smiling buddha and india s military might you must remember 20 years ago today on 11th may 1998 the prime minister of india shri atal bihari vajpayee had said while addressing the nation and his words filled the whole country with pride courage and elation the indian diaspora was infused with new confidence that day also was the day of buddha purnima on may 11 1998 at india s western end a nuclear test was conducted in pokhran rajasthan it has been 20 years since pokhranand this test was done on buddha purnima with the blessings of lord buddha india s test was not only successful but in a way india had demonstrated its might in the field of science and technology we can also say 11 may 1988 is engraved in the history of india as a demonstration of her military power lord buddha has shown the world that the power of inner strength or that of the soul is necessary for peace similarly when you are sturdy as a nation you can be at peace with others the month of may 1998 is not just important for the country from the aspect that nuclear tests were conducted this very month but the manner in which they were carried out is also important it has revealed to the entire world that india is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership india can reach loftier destinations and earn new laurels on that day shri atal bihari vajpayee ji had given the mantra jai jawan jai kisan jai vigyan now that when we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the pokhran test conducted on may 11 1998 i ask the younger generations of our nation to imbibe the mantra of jai vigyan given by atalji for enhancing the might and the power of india to build a modern india a powerful india and a self reliant india synergize your energy with the strength of india witnessing the journey that atal ji started we while continuing onwards on that very path with a renewed joy will derive great satisfaction in getting ahead my dear countrymen looking forward to our conversation

He praised those who have dedicated their lives to serving the nation, including individuals working with Naxal-affected areas, tribal languages, and cultural preservation in the North-East. "
29-Aug-21,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on August 29, 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi commemorated National Sports Day, celebrated on the birth anniversary of Major Dhyan Chand, highlighting the resurgence of Indian hockey at the Tokyo Olympics after four decades. He emphasized the changing mindset of the youth, their inclination towards innovation and excellence, and the growing startup culture. The Prime Minister discussed the significance of maintaining the momentum in sports and encouraged the entire nation to promote sports and games, preserving Major Dhyan Chand's legacy. He also discussed the importance of cleanliness and shared success stories from Indore and other places. PM Modi celebrated the Sanskrit language and mentioned initiatives to promote it in India and around the world. He encouraged efforts to strengthen skills and respect for skilled individuals, relating it to the upcoming Vishwakarma Jayanti. The Prime Minister called for a collective push to make resolutions and contribute to India's progress in its 75th year of Independence while urging continued COVID-19 vaccination and precautions. He concluded by inviting people to send him letters and messages with their innovative ideas.",29-aug-2021 my dear countrymen namaskar all of us know that today is the birth anniversary of major dhyanchand ji and our country celebrates it as national sports day in commemoration a thought struck me that perhaps wherever major dhyanchand ji s soul must be at the moment it must be feeling overjoyed since it was dhyanchand ji s hockey that brought glory to indian hockey in the whole world and four decades later almost after 41 years the youth of india her sons and daughters once again infused vitality in our hockey and irrespective of the number of medals won no citizen of india enjoys victory until a medal is won in hockey and this time in the olympics the medal that was won for hockey came our way after four decades you can imagine wherever major dhyanchand ji might be his heart his soul must be overflowing with joy and the entire life of dhyanchand ji was dedicated to sports and that is why today when the youth of the country our sons and daughters are visibly drawn towards sports with even parents experiencing happiness on children coming forward in sports this eagerness that one can see all over i feel that itself is a great tribute to major dhyanchand ji friends whenever the subject of sports and games is touched upon the entire young generation comes into view naturally so and when we cast a keen glance at the young generation we notice a sweeping change there the mind of the youth has undergone a transformation and today s young minds shunning obsolete age old methods and patterns want to do something new altogether something different today s young mind does not want to tread ready made beaten paths it wants to carve out newer paths it wants to step on unknown territory new destinations new goals as well new roads new aspirations as well and once a young person decides in the mind no stone is left unturned in the pursuit persevering day and night we see how some time ago when india opened her space sector within no time the young generation lapped up the opportunity and to avail of its benefits college students and young people working in universities and the private sector enthusiastically came forward and i firmly believe that in the coming days a large number of satellites would be of those developed by our youth our students our colleges our universities students working in labs similarly wherever you see go to any family however well to do however educated the family might be if you speak to a young person in the family she or he moving away from family traditions express the wish to do a start up or join a start up excitedly willing to take a risk today the startup culture is expanding even to smaller cities and i am seeing it as an indication of a bright future just a few days ago toys in our country were being discussed within no time when this caught the attention of our youth they too resolutely decided to work towards positioning indian toys in the world with a distinct identity and they are trying out ever new experiments the world is a huge market for toys a market of 6 to 7 lakh crores today india s share is miniscule but how to craft toys what diversity to be lent to toys what technology to be used how toys should be compatible with child psychology these are points where the youth of the country is applying minds to wishing to contribute something friends there s one more thing that fills the heart with joy and further strengthens the belief and what is that have you ever marked generally what had crept into our fabric was acceptance of mediocrity it happens it s okay this will do but now i m noticing my country s young minds focusing themselves on excellence they want to do the best using the best methods this too will emerge as a major force for the nation friends this time the olympics have created a major impact the events at the olympics are over the paralympics are going on whatever our country earned in this world of sports may be little in comparison with the world but enough has happened to bolster our belief today it is not that the youth is just watching sports the youth is also looking at possibilities associated with sports observing the entire eco system minutely comprehending its potential wishing to connect with it in some way or the other she or he now wants to surpass conventional ways and adopt new disciplines and my dear countrymen now that such a momentum has been built up sports has begun to be discussed in every family do tell me should this momentum be allowed to subside to halt now no not at all even you must be thinking on the similar lines in the country now sports and games sportsman spirit is not to stop in family life in social life in the life of the nation this momentum has to be accorded permanence infusing it with energy replenishing it with relentless new energy at home or elsewhere in villages or cities our playgrounds must be filled up let all play let all bloom and i m sure you remember what i had said from red fort sabka prayas yes collective endeavour it is only through collective endeavour of all that india will attain glorious heights in sports that she rightfully deserves on the course charted by people such as major dhyanchand ji we have to move forward it s our responsibility after years has the country witnessed a period where in families in society in states in the nation all the people are single mindedly forging a bond with sports my dear young friends taking advantage of this opportunity we must garner expertise in a variety of sports in villages as well sports competitions should be held successively it is only through competition that a sport evolves progresses giving rise to sportspersons as an outcome come let all us countrymen strive to further this momentum as much as we can contributing whatever we can let us transform the mantra of sabka prayas into reality my dear countrymen tomorrow also happens to be the grand festival of janmashtmi this festival of janmashtami that is the festival of birth of bhagwan shri krishna we are familiar with all the forms of bhagwan from naughty kanhaiya to the one taking colossal form krishna from the one well versed in scriptures to one skilled in weaponary be it art beauty charm where all isn t krishna there but i am saying all this because a few days before jamashtami i had gone through an interesting experience so i felt i should talk about this to you you must be aware that on the 20th of this month the construction work related to bhagwan somnath temple has been dedicated to the people 3 4 kilometers away from somnath temple is the bhalka teerth this bhalka teerth is the place where bhagwan shri krishna spent his last moments on earth in a way his leelas divine acts in this world culminated there many works for the development of that entire region are being done by the somnath trust i was thinking of bhalaka teerth and the works going on there when i noticed a beautiful art book someone had left this book for me outside my residence in this there were many forms and many magnificent pictures of bhagwan shri krishna pictures were very attractive and very meaningful my curiosity grew all the more when i started turning the pages of the book when i saw the book and all the pictures and the message for me written there i felt l should meet the one who had left it for me i should meet the one who has left the book outside my home so my office contacted the person such was my curiosity on seeing the art book on seeing the different forms of bhagwan shri krishna that i called the person to meet the very next day with this curiosity i met jaduarani dasi ji she is american was born in america brought up in america jadurani dasi ji is connected to iskcon connected to harey krishna movement and one of her major specialities is that she is skilled in bhakti arts you know that just after two days on the 1st of september we have the 125th birth anniversary of the founder of iskcon shri prabhupaad swami ji jadurani dasi ji had come to india in this very connection the question before me was that one who was born in america who had been so far away from the indian ethos how could she make such attractive pictures of bhagwan shir krishna i had a long chat with her but i want you to listen to some parts of it pm sir jadurani ji hare krishna i have read a little about bhakti art but tell our listeners more about it your passion and interest towards it is great jadurani ji so bhakti art we have one article in the bhakti art illuminations which explains how this art is not coming from the mind or imagination but it is from the ancient vedic scriptures like bhram sanhita ven omkaraya patitam skilatam sikand from the goswami s of vrindavan from the lord brahma himself eeshwarah paramah krishnah sachchidanand vigrahah how he carries the flute how all of his senses can act for any other sense and srimad bhagwatam tcr 9 09 barhapeend natwarvapuh karnayoh karnakaram everything he wears a karnika flower on his ear he makes the impression of his lotus feet all over the land of vrindavan the cow herds voicing of his glories his flute attracts the hearts and minds of all fortunate beings so everything is from ancient vedic scriptures and the power of these scriptures which are coming from transcendental personalities and the pure devotees who are bringing it the art has their power and that s why its transformational it is not my power at all pm sir jadurani ji i have different type of question for you since 1966 in a way and from 1976 physically you have been associated with india for long will you please tell me what does india mean to you jadurani ji prime minister ji india means everything to me i was mentioning i think to hon ble president a few days ago that india has come up so much in technical advancement and following the west very well with twitter and instagram and iphones and big buildings and so much facility but i know that that s not the real glory of india what makes india glorious is the fact that krishna himself the avatari appeared here and all the avatars appeared here lord shiva appeared here lord ram appeared here all the holy rivers are here all the holy places of vaishnav culture are here and so india especially vrindavan is the most important place in the universe vrindavan is the source of all the vaikunth planets the source of dwarika the source of the whole material creation so i love india pm sir thank you jadurani ji hare krishna friends when the people of the world pay heed to indian spiritual systems and philosophy today then we also have a responsibility to carry forward these great traditions that which has perished has to be left behind but that which is timeless has to be carried forward let us celebrate our festivals understand its scientific meaning and the connotation behind it not only this there is an underlying message in every festival there is a sanskar as well we not only have to know it live it and pass it on as a legacy for generations to come i once again wish all the countrymen a very happy janmashtami my dear countrymen during this corona period the myriad aspects of cleanliness that i should have touched upon i feel perhaps that it saw a decrease i also feel that we should not let the cleanliness campaign diminish even at the slightest the examples of how efforts by everyone for nation building in turn lead to progress for all of us also inspire us and infuse us with a new energy to do something impart new confidence give a meaning to our resolve we know very well that whenever the topic swachh bharat abhiyan comes up the name of indore also arises because indore has created a special identity of its own in relation to cleanliness and the people of indore are also entitled to felicitations our indore has remained at number one in swachh bharat ranking for many years now the people of indore do not want to sit satisfied with this ranking of swachh bharat they want to move forward want to do something new and now they have decided to maintain a water plus city and are striving for it with all their might water plus city means a city where no sewage is dumped into any public water source without treatment the citizens here themselves have come forward and connected their drains with the sewer line a cleanliness campaign has also been started and due to this the polluted water draining in the saraswati and kanh rivers has also reduced considerably and an improvement is visible today when our country is celebrating the amrit mahotsav of independence we have to remember that we should never let the resolve of the swachh bharat abhiyan diminish the greater the number of cities which are water plus city in our country cleanliness will increase further our rivers will also become clean and we will be fulfilling values associated with humane responsibility of conserving water friends before me is an example that has come from madhubani in bihar dr rajendra prasad agricultural university in madhubani and the local krishi vigyan kendra have jointly made a worthy effort not only farmers are accruing benefit from this scheme but it has also imparted renewed vigour to the swachh bharat abhiyan the name of this initiative of the university is sukhet model the purpose of the sukhet model is to reduce pollution in the villages under this model dung and other household waste is collected from the farmers of the village and in return the villagers are given money for cooking gas cylinders the work of making vermicompost from the disposed garbage collected from the village is also ongoing therefore there are four benefits of the sukhet model that are directly visible one the village is freed from pollution the second is that the village is freed from filth the third is that the money for the lpg cylinder goes to the villagers and the fourth is that the farmers of the village get bio fertilizer you must give it a thought as to how such efforts can increase the power of our villages this is the basis of self reliance i appeal that every panchayat of the country should also think of doing something like this in their respective villages and friends when we set out with a goal it is certain that we achieve the results now look at our kanjirangal panchayat of sivaganga district in tamil nadu see what this small panchayat has done here you will get to see another model of wealth from the waste here the gram panchayat along with the local people has started an indigenous project to generate electricity from waste in their village the garbage is collected from the entire village electricity is generated from it and the residual products are also sold as pesticides the capacity of this village power plant is to dispose of two tonnes of waste per day the electricity generated from this power plant is utilized for streetlights and other needs of the village the money saved by the panchayat through this scheme is being used for other developmental works now tell me a small panchayat in sivaganga district of tamil nadu inspires all of us countrymen to do something or not they have achieved wonders haven t they my dear countrymen mann ki baat is no longer confined to the borders of india there is a discussion on mann ki baat in different corners of the world too and there are people from our indian community living abroad who keep providing me with much new information and i also like to sometimes share with you the unique programs that are going on abroad in mann ki baat even today i will introduce you to some such people but before that i want to play an audio for you listen carefully 2 2 friends you must have understood the language this was sanskrit being spoken on the radio and the one speaking was rj ganga rj ganga is a member of a group of radio jockeys in gujarat her other companions are rj neelam rj guru and rj hetal all of them together in gujarat in kevadiya are currently engaged in enhancing respect for the sanskrit language and you also know that this is the same kevadiya where the world s tallest statue the pride of our country the statue of unity is located that is the very kevadiya i am talking about and the radio jockeys are such that they wear multiple hats simultaneously they also serve as guides and also run the community radio initiative radio unity 90 fm these rjs talk to their listeners in sanskrit language providing them with information in sanskrit friends in these parts it is said about sanskrit that is our sanskrit language is sweet and also simple through its thoughts and medium of literary texts sanskrit helps nurture knowledge and also national unity strengthens it sanskrit literature comprises the divine philosophy of humanity and knowledge which can captivate anyone s attention recently i got to know about many such people who are engaged in the inspirational work of teaching sanskrit in foreign lands one such person is mr rutger kortenhorst a well known sanskrit scholar and teacher in ireland who teaches sanskrit to the children there sanskrit language also plays an important role in the strengthening of cultural relations between india and ireland and between india and thailand here in the east dr chirapat prapandavidya and dr kusuma rakshamani both of them are playing a very important role in the promotion of sanskrit language in thailand they have also carried out comparative studies in literature of thai and sanskrit languages another such professor is shriman boris zakharin who teaches sanskrit at moscow state university in russia he has published many research papers and books he has also translated many books from sanskrit to russian likewise sydney sanskrit school is one of australia s premier institutions where sanskrit language is taught to the students for children these schools also organize programs like sanskrit grammar camp sanskrit plays and sanskrit day friends the efforts which have been made in recent times have brought a new awareness about sanskrit now is the time to increase our efforts in this direction it is our collective duty to cherish our heritage preserve it pass it on to the new generation and future generations also have a right to it now is the time to increase everyone s efforts for these works as well friends if you know of any such person engaged in this kind of effort if you have any such information then please share the information related to them on social media with the hashtag celebrating sanskrit my dear countrymen in the next few days vishwakarma jayanti will also be celebrated here bhagwan vishwakarma is considered as a symbol of the creative power behind the genesis of the world whoever through their skill builds an object innovates whether it is sewing embroidery software or satellite all this is a manifestation of bhagwan vishwakarma even though skill is being recognized in a new way in the world today our sages and seers have emphasized on skill and scale for thousands of years they have interlinked skill talent ability with faith thereby making it a part of the philosophy of our lives our vedas have also dedicated many sookta to bhagwan vishwakarma whichever great creations are there whatever new and big works have been done our scriptures ascribe them to bhagwan vishwakarma it is in a way a symbol of the thought that whatever development and innovation is happening in the world happens only through skills this is the very sentiment behind the birth anniversary of bhagwan vishwakarma and his worship and this has been quoted in our scriptures too meaning the one who takes all efforts in the process of creating and building is a vishwakarma in the view of our scriptures all the skilled talented people around us engaged in the process of creation and building are the legacy of bhagwan vishwakarma our lives without such individuals would be unfathomable think about it if there is some problem with electricity in your house and you cannot find an electrician how will it be you will have to face a big hurdle our life goes on because of many such skilled people look around yourself be it an ironsmith a potter a carpenter an electrician a house painter a sanitation worker or someone who repairs mobile laptops all of them are known only because of their skill in modern form all of them are also vishwakarma but friends there is another aspect to it and it also sometimes causes concern the situation in our country where culture tradition thinking skill manpower have been interlinked with bhagwan vishwakarma and how it has changed once upon a time kaushalya our innate skills had a huge impact on our family life social life and life of the natio but during the long period of slavery and subjugation the feeling that gave such respect to skill gradually faded into oblivion the thinking became such that skill based tasks were considered inferior and now see today the whole world is emphasizing the most on skill the worship of bhagwan vishwakarma is also not to be completed only with formalities we have to respect the talent we have to work hard to be skilled we should be proud to be skilled when we do something new innovate something create something that will benefit the society make people s life easier then our vishwakarma puja will be meaningful there is no dearth of opportunities for skilled people in the world today skills are forging multiple paths of progress come this time let us take a pledge to follow the message of bhagwan vishwakarma along with faith in his worship the spirit of our worship should be such that we understand the importance of skill and also give full respect to skilled people no matter what work they do this is the time of the 75th year of our independence this year we have to make new resolutions every day think new and bolster our spirit to do something new when india completes one hundred years of independence then only these resolutions of ours will be seen in the foundation of its successes so we should not let this opportunity pass we have to contribute our maximum in this and in the midst of all these efforts we have one more thing to remember vaccinate and take precautions more than 62 crore vaccine doses have been administered in the country but still we have to be careful be vigilant and yes as always whenever you do something new think new then definitely

we shall usher our selves into a new year and a new decade the third decade of the 21st century i extend my heartiest greetings to all countrymen on the arrival of year 2020 one thing is certain about the decade to come and that is it will witness the active contribution of those who were born in the 21st century in the country s progress these are people who are growing up understanding the significant issues pertaining to this century the young people such as these are known by myriad terms for some they are millennials others call them generation z or gen zee too and broadly speaking one thing that has captured the collective psyche is that this is the social media generation all of us experience that this generation is extremely talented it thrives on the dream to do something new something different it has its own set of opinions and the best part is especially in the case of india according to me they appreciate the system not just that they prefer to follow the system and in the event of the system not responding properly they get restless and even courageously question the system itself i consider this attribute as a virtue one can even say with certitude here that the country s youth detests anarchy of any sort they despise any element of lack of governance and instability abhorring any shades of nepotism casteism favouritism or gender discrimination there are times when we see them at an airport or a cinema theatre if someone tries to break a queue the first to react vociferously are these young people and we have noticed if such an incident takes place the youth present around make a video of it on their mobile phones which goes viral within no time and the culprit instantly realizes the consequence thus our new generation is an embodiment a reflection of a new system a new order a new age a new thought today india eagerly awaits this generation expectantly these are the very people who have to elevate the country to greater heights swami vivekanand ji had observed my faith is in the younger generation the modern generation out of them will come my workers referring to the youth he had remarked the value of youth can neither be ascertained nor described youth is the most valuable phase of one s life your life future entirely depends on the way your utilized your youth according to vivekanand ji young people are the one s full of energy and dynamism possessing the power to usher in change i am of the firm belief that for india this decade will be not only about development progress of the youth it will also prove to be about the country s progress harnessing their collective might this generation will play a major role in modernizing india i feel it beyond any doubt on the birth anniversary of vivekanand on the 12th of january on the occasion of national youth day every young person should give a thought to this responsibility taking on resolve or the other for this decade my dear countrymen many of you must be aware of the rock in kanyakumari where swami vivekanand ji had entered into the meditative state the spiritual antardhyan that very rock memorial is completing 50 years of existence for the last five decades it has earned a place of pride for india kanyakumari exudes a special attraction nationally as well as for the world for anyone seeking to experience spiritual consciousness filled with national pride this has become a centre of pilgrimage a temple of faith swamiji s memorial has inspiringly instilled a sense of national pride amongst people irrespective of their sect age or class it has shown the way to realize follow the mantra in service of the poorest of the poor whoever visits the place naturally experiences a surge of inner energy a sense of positivity the resolve to contribute something to the country recently in connection with the 50 years our honourable president paid a visit to the rock memorial and it s a matter of joy that our vice president too visited the desert festival held in rann of kutch gujarat for the inauguration when our hon ble president vice president are visiting such important tourist destinations in india it is bound to inspire our countrymen i urge you too to travel visit these places my dear countrymen all of us study in myriad colleges universities schools but after completing studies alumni meets are joyous occasions at any alumni meet members come together sharing youthful memories going back 10 20 or even 25 years at times such meets turn out to be a special attraction that gets noticed and it is also important for it to catch the attention of our countrymen actually an alumni meet is an occasion for old friends to come together refresh memories these are happy moments indeed alongside if this union comprises a shared purpose a resolve an emotional connect it lends additional hues to the event you must have seen alumni groups at times contributing something or the other to their schools some arrange for systems for computerization some organize a better library others go for revamping drinking water facilities or new rooms some have gone to the extent of facilitating sports complexes one thing or the other it gives them inner joy to do something for the place that shaped their life everyone feels so and should feel so and people do come forward for the same but today i wish to present before you a special occasion just recently i came across on the media a story on the bhairavganj health centre in the west champaran district of bihar it was such a nice feeling that i could not stop myself from sharing it with you at this bhairavganj health centre thousands of people from neighbouring villages converged for a free health check up of course you will not be surprised at that you may say so what what is new in that people must have thronged there as usual not at all a lot about it was new this was not a government programme nor was it a government initiative this was a step taken as part of an alumni meet organized by former students of the local k r high school and they named it sankalp 95 sankalp 95 means the resolve undertaken by the 1995 batch of that high school actually students of this batch held an alumni meet and thought of doing something different under this the former students resolved to do something for society and decided to shoulder responsibility in the area of public health awareness under the aegis of sankalp ninety five government medical college of bettiah and many hospitals also joined in this campaign and after that an entire movement centred on public health got started be it free medical tests distribution of free medicines or just spreading awareness sankalp ninety five has become a shining beacon for everyone we often say that when every citizen of the country takes a step ahead our nation moves 130 crore steps forward and when such things are witnessed first hand in the society then everyone gets elated derives satisfaction and is infused with motivation to do something in life on one hand in bettiah in bihar a group of alumni took up the task of health care delivery on the other some women of phulpur in uttar pradesh have inspired the entire region with their tenacity these women have proved that if a resolution is taken with the true spirit of solidarity nothing can stop conditions changing for the better till some time ago these women of phulpur were hampered by financial constraints and poverty but they had the resolve to do something for their families and society these women aligned withthe women self help group of kadipur joined in learning the skill of making slippers and thus not only managed to pluck the thorn of helplessness from their feet but by becoming self reliant also became the support of their families with the help of gramin ajivika mission a slipper manufacturing plant has also been established here where slippers are being made with the help of modern machines i especially congratulate the local police and their families who encouraged these women entrepreneurs by purchasing slippers for themselves and their families made by these women today due to the resolve of these women not only the financial condition of their families have been fortified their standard of living has also improved whenever i hear about the police personnel of phulpur or their families you will also recollect that i had urged from the ramparts of red fort on the 15th of august requesting the countrymen to buy local produce preferably today once again i suggest can we promote locally made products can we prioritize them in our shopping can we link local products with our status and pride can we become a medium to bring prosperity to our fellow countrymen with this spirit friends mahatma gandhi viewed this spirit of swadeshi as a lamp illuminating the lives of millions as well as bringing prosperity in the lives of the poorest of the poor a hundred years ago gandhiji started a huge public movement to promote indian products as one of its objectives this was the path shown by gandhi ji towards self reliance the india that we breathe freely in was liberated by millions of worthy sons and daughters who underwent numerous tortures and hardships many even sacrificing their lives we attained freedom owing to sacrifice and penance of innumerable people a freedom that we are fully enjoying we hardly know the names of those countless beings who made the supreme sacrifice for the country who went through untold hardships for her of some we know others will always stay anonymous they all made sacrifices firmly carrying that dream in their hearts that of a free india for the sake of a prosperous flourishing and free india my dear countrymen can we pledge that by 2022 when we achieve 75 years of independence we insist and remain steadfast at least for about two three years on buying local products products made in india made by the hands of our citizens carrying the fragrance of the sweat of our countrymen can t we resolve to buy such things i do not advocate this for a long time just till 2022 till the completion of 75 years of independence and this work should not be carried out by government instead of this young people should step forward at various places form small organizations motivate people explain and decide come we will buy only local products emphasize on local products carrying the fragrance of the sweat of our countrymen that will be the exultant moment of my free india let these be the dreams with which we proceed my dear countrymen it is very important for all of us that the citizens of our country become self reliant and live their lives with dignity i would like to discuss one such initiative that has caught my attention and that is the himayat programme of jammu kashmir and ladakh the himayat programme is actually associated with skill development and employment in this programme teenagers and youth from 15 to 35 years of age those denizens of jammu and kashmir whose studies for some reason could not be completed who had to leave school and college midstream are associated my dear countrymen it would gladden you that under the aegis of this programme during the last two years eighteen thousand youths have been trained in seventy seven different trades out of these around five thousand people are working somewhere or the other and many have moved towards self employment the success stories of lives which have changed under the aegis of the himayat programme truly touch the heart parveen fatima has become a supervisor cum coordinator following a promotion in a garment unit in tirupur tamil nadu until a year ago she was living in a small village in kargil at present her life has undergone a major change she has become confident she has become self reliant and has also brought an opportunity for prosperity for her entire family like parveen fatima the himayatprogramme has changed the fate of other daughters and residents of leh ladakh region and all of them are working in the same firm in tamil nadu today similarly the himayat programme came as a boon for fiaz ahmad of doda district fiaz passed the 12thclass examination in 2012 but due to an illness he could not continue his studies fiaz battled a heart disease for two years meanwhile one of his brothers and a sister also died in a way his family was overwhelmed by trials and tribulations eventually he was helped by the himayat programme he received training in ites i e information technology enabled services uder the aegis of the himayat programme and today he is employed in punjab fiyaz ahmed s graduate studies which he continued simultaneously with his training under the himayat programme is also nearing completion recently he was invited to share his experience at a himayat programme fiyaz while narrating his story had tears welling in his eyes similarly rakib ul rahman of anantnag could not complete his studies due to financial constraints one day rakib came to know about the himayat programme through a mobilisation camp in his block rakib immediately enrolled himself in the retail team leader course after completing his training today he is working in a corporate house there are many examples of talented youth who have become symbols of change in jammu and kashmir benefiting from himayat mission the himayatprogramme is a perfect example of a great synergy between the government training partners job providing companies and the people of jammu and kashmir this program has given a new found confidence to the youth in jammu and kashmir and shown them a way to forge ahead my dear countrymen on the 26th of this month we witnessed the last solar eclipse of this decade possibly this solar eclipse prompted ripun to write a very interesting comment on the mygov portal he writes hello sir my name is ripun i belong to the north east and am currently working in south india i would like to share something with you i remember that due to the clear skies in our region we used to gaze at the stars in the sky for hours together i used to enjoy star gazing now i am a professional and because of my daily routine i am unable to find time for such activities can you discuss this topic in your show particularly on how to popularise astronomy among the youth my dear countrymen i receive a lot of suggestions but it would be safe to say that this suggestion is unique i have often spoken about many aspects of science especially the insistence of the youth has given me an opportunity to talk about science but this topic has never been broached and since the solar eclipse occurred on the 26th of this month possibly you might also be interested in this topic like my countrymen especially the youth among them i too was eager to watch the solar eclipse on the 26th of december but unfortunately on that day overcast skies in delhi prevented me from enjoying the sight though i did get to see beautiful pictures of the solar eclipse that was visible in kozhikode and some other parts of india the sun was visible in the form of a shining ring on that day i had the opportunity to talk to some experts in this field and they told me that this is caused due to the fact that the moon is located far away from the earth and hence it is unable to completely cover the sun hence a ring like shape is formed this solar eclipse is an annular solar eclipse also referred to as valay grahan or kundal grahan the eclipse reminds us that that we are travelling in space while residing on the earth sun moon and other planets and celestial bodies are orbiting in space due to the shadow of the moon we get to see the various forms of solar eclipse friends india has an ancient and glorious history of astronomy our connection with the twinkling stars in the sky is as old as our civilisation many of you might be aware that at various places in india there are magnificent observatories jantar mantars which are worth seeing and these observatories have a deep bond with astronomy who doesn t know about the prodigious talent of the great aryabhatta during his career he has expounded in great detail about the solar eclipse as well as the lunar eclipse and he has explained it both from a philosophical as well as a mathematical standpoint mathematically he has described how to calculate the size of the shadow of the earth he has also provided accurate information on how to calculate the duration and extent of the eclipse his disciples like bhaskara strived hard to further this spirit of inquiry and knowledge later in the fourteenth or fifteenth century maadhav of sangam village in kerala used calculus to calculate the position of planets in the universe the night sky was not merely something that whetted the curiosity it was an important source for mathematicians and scientists a few years ago i had unveiled a book called pre modern kutchi navigation techniques and voyages this book in a way is the diary of maalam maalam was a navigator and whatever he experienced professionally he recorded it in his diary even in the modern age the very same maalam s volume exists as a collection of ancient gujarati manuscripts it describes ancient navigation technology and that maalam s volume repeatedly references the sky the stars the speed of the stars and clearly describes how the direction is determined in sea voyages with the help of stars it is stars that navigate us towards our destination my dear countrymen india is quite advanced in the field of astronomy and we have taken path breaking initiatives in this field we have a giant meter wave telescope near pune not just that in kodaikkaanal udagamandala guru shikhar and hanle ladakh as well powerful telescopes are located in 2016 the then prime minister of belgium and i had inaugurated the 3 6 metre devasthal optical telescope in nainital this is known as asia s largest telescope isro has an astronomical satellite called astrosat isro is planning to launch a satellite called aditya to study the sun whether it be our ancient knowledge in astronomy or modern achievements in this field we should strive to understand them and feel proud of them today our young scientists not only display a great desire to know their scientific history but also are resolute in fashioning astronomy s future the planetariums in our country in addition to increasing the understanding of the night sky also motivate people to develop star gazing as a hobby many people install amateur telescopes on their balconies or terrace star gazing can also encourage rural camps and rural picnics and there are many such schools and colleges that form astronomy clubs and such steps must be encouraged my dear countrymen we consider our parliament as the temple of our democracy today i wish to proudly mention that the parliamentarians that you have elected have broken all the records of the last 60 years in the last 6 months both the sessions of the 17th lok sabha have been very productive lok sabha s productivity stands at 114 while that of rajya sabha is 94 and prior to that in the budget session it had a productivity of 135 often parliament functioned till late at night i am mentioning this because all parliamentarians deserve to be congratulated and complimented for this the parliamentarians that you elected have broken all the records of the last 60 years so much accomplishment in itself shows the strength of indian democracy and the faith in democracy i wish to congratulate all the presiding officers all political parties and all members of parliament for their active role in this regard my dear countrymen the movement of the sun moon and earth doesn t just determine eclipses rather many other things are also associated with them we all know that based on the sun s motion various festivals will be celebrated throughout india in the middle of january from punjab to tamil nadu from gujarat to assam people will celebrate various festivals makar sankraanti and uttaraayan is celebrated with great fervour in the month of january they are considered a symbol of energy during this time we will see the celebration of lohri in punjab pongal in tamil nadu and maagh biihu in assam these festivals have a close link with the prosperity of farmers and their crops these festivals remind us of india s unity as well as its diversity the countrymen have the proud privilege to celebrate the last day of pongal as the birth anniversary of the great tiruvalluvar this day is dedicated to the great writer philosopher saint tiruvalluvar and his life my dear countrymen this is the final episode of man ki baat in 2019 we will meet again in 2020 new year new decade new

29-Jan-17,"In his 'Mann Ki Baat' address on January 29, 2017, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reflected on the importance of emphasizing the duties of citizens in addition to their rights, especially during Republic Day celebrations. He encouraged the youth to research and share stories about gallantry award recipients to inspire others. Modi expressed condolences for the soldiers who lost their lives due to avalanches in Kashmir. He addressed the stress and anxiety faced by students during exams, suggesting that exams should be seen as a joyous occasion and promoting a festival-like atmosphere at home to reduce pressure. He highlighted the significance of holistic development, proper rest, and physical activities, like sports, alongside studies. Modi also praised the Indian Coast Guard on its 40th anniversary, noting its achievements in securing maritime borders and environmental protection, including coastal cleanliness campaigns. He extended his wishes for Vasant Panchami, a festival of knowledge and inspiration. Modi commended All India Radio for broadcasting regional language versions of 'Mann Ki Baat' to connect with a wider audience.",29-jan-2017 my fellow citizens my namaskar to all of you 26th january our republic day was celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every nook and corner of the nation by all of us the constitution of india the duties of citizens the rights of citizens and our commitment to democracy these in a way make republic day also a festival of sanskaars which makes our future generations cognizant of democracy and their democratic responsibilities and also imparts to them the culture moral values and norms inherent in our democracy but still in our country the duties and rights of citizens are not being debated and discussed as intensively and extensively as it should be done i hope that the amount of emphasis that is given to the rights at every level during most of the time is also given to discussing duties of citizens in an emphatic manner the rights and duties of the citizens constitute the railway track on which the train of democracy in india can move ahead at a fast pace tomorrow is 30th january the death anniversary of our revered bapu all of us pay tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the motherland by observing silence for 2 minutes at 11 am on 30th january as a society as a nation the 2 minute tribute of silence on 30th january at 11 am should become our instinctive nature this 2 minutes silence is an expression of our collective resolve and reverence for the martyrs in our country there is an innate respect for the military and the security forces i congratulate and felicitate the young heroes and their families who were honoured with various gallantry awards on the eve of this republic day there are various categories of these gallantry awards like kirti chakra shaurya chakra vishisht seva medal and param vishisht seva medal i want to urge the youth especially that since you are very active on social media you can do one thing surf the net to do some research on the valiant bravehearts who have been bestowed with these honours compose a few good lines about them and share these with your friends and companions when we get to know the in depth details of their courage bravery valour in detail we are filled with astonishment and pride and we also get inspired while we were all delighted with the tidings of enthusiasm and celebration of 26th january at the same time some of our army jawans posted in kashmir for the defense of the country achieved martyrdom due to the avalanche i respectfully pay my homage to all these brave soldiers i bow to them my young friends you know very well that i regularly do my mann ki baat january february march april all these are for every family months of most severe test normally it is one or two children in a home due to appear at their exams but the entire family feels the burden of it this led me to believe that this is the right time for me to talk to my student friends their guardians and their teachers because for many years now wherever i have gone whomsoever i have met examination appeared to be a great source of anxiety troubled families harassed students tense teachers one sees a very strange psychological atmosphere prevailing in each home and i have always felt that we should come out of this situation and therefore today i want to talk in some detail with my young friends when i d declared that i would talk on this topic many teachers guardians and students sent me their messages questions suggestions and also expressed their anguish and narrated their problems and after going through all these outpourings some ideas came to my mind which i want to share with you today i received a telephonic message from srishti you too listen to what srishti has to say sir i want to tell you that during exam time very often in our homes in the neighbourhood and in our society a very terrifying and scary atmosphere pervades this leads to a situation where the students instead of feeling inspired feel tremendously down so i just want to ask you this can t this be transformed into a pleasant atmosphere well the question has been posed by srishti but it is a question that must be there in the minds of all of you exams in themselves should be a joyous occasion after a year of hard work one has the opportunity to display one s capabilities so this should be a festival of joy and enthusiasm but there are very few people for whom there is pleasure in the exam for most people exam means pressure now it is up to you to decide whether you consider the exams pleasure or pressure those who will consider it a pleasure will have achievements while those who will consider exams a pressure will have to repent and therefore my opinion is that exams are like a festival and hence must be celebrated and when there is a festive mood of celebration the best within us comes out the true realisation of the strength of a society also takes place during festivals the best of everything finds a manifestation usually we think of ourselves as a highly undisciplined lot but if we just look at the arrangements made during the kumbh melas which are celebrated for about 40 45 days these despite being essentially make shift arrangements display the great discipline practised by people this is the inherent strength of a festival hence during examinations too an atmosphere of festivity should be created in the whole family amongst friends and around the neighbourhood and you will see for yourself that the pressure will be converted into pleasure the festive atmosphere will lead to a burden free environment and i especially urge the parents to create a festive atmosphere during these 3 4 months all the family members have to work as a team and play with zeal their respective roles to make this festival of examination a success you will witness for yourself the ensuing change actually from kashmir to kanyakumari and from kutch to kamrup and from amreli to arunachal pradesh these 3 4 months have examinations galore it is the responsibility of each one of us that in our own ways observing our respective traditions and in tune with our respective family surroundings we should strive to transform every year these 3 4 months into a festival and therefore i shall say to you smile more score more the more time these days you will spend being happy the more will be the number of marks you will earn just try and see for yourselves and you must have noticed that when you are happy you are smiling you become relaxed automatically and when you relax instinctively you re able to recollect very old things also quite effortlessly a year ago what the teacher had taught in the classroom the whole scenario reappears in front of you and you must know that the power of memory to recall is greatest when we are relaxed if you are tense then all the doors seem to be closed nothing can enter from outside and nothing can come out from inside the thought process comes to a standstill and that in itself becomes a burden you must have seen for yourself that during the examinations also you re able to recall everything else the book the chapter the page number whether what you want is there on the top of the page or at its bottom you can recall everything but not the particular word you want to but as soon as you finish the examination and exit from the examination hall suddenly you recollect that very word and you say to yourself yes man that was the word i wanted why you could not remember the word inside the hall was due to the pressure and how you could recall it outside it was the same you nobody had now told you the answer what happened was that whatever was inside came out immediately and the reason was that you were now relaxed and therefore the most effective medicine that exists for memory recall is relaxation and it is by my own personal experience that i m telling you that if you re under pressure then you forget even your own things but if you are relaxed then you can t even imagine the kind of things you are able to remember and these become extremely useful it is not that you do not have the knowledge it is not that you do not have the information and it is not that you have not worked hard but when there is tension your knowledge your wisdom your information all these buckle under and the tension rides over you and therefore it is necessary to remember that a happy mind is the secret for a good mark sheet sometimes it also appears that we are not able to perceive examinations in a proper perspective it seems to become a question of life and death see the exam you are going to appear at is the exam of what you have studied during this whole year but it is not a test of your life it is not a test of what kind of life have you lived how is the life you are living now and what is the life you aspire to live there must have been many occasions in your life when besides the examinations that you appeared at inside the classrooms with notebooks you had to encounter and endure many tests and trials and thus success and failure in life is not determined at all by how one has done at the examination this is a burden from which you must free yourself we all have before us the extremely inspiring example of our former president dr a p j abdul kalam he appeared at the test for recruitment into the air force and failed in that now suppose that this failure had caused him to become dejected to concede defeat in his life then would india have found such a great scientist and such a glorious president no never one richa anand ji has sent me this question today what i see as the biggest challenge facing the education is that it has come to focus solely on examinations marks have become all important as a result the competition has multiplied leading to a very high increase of stress in the students also so i would like to know your views concerning the current direction of education and its future course although she herself has given the answer to her query but richa ji wishes that i too must put forth my views on the matter marks and mark sheet serve a limited purpose life is not confined to these only life truly means what is the knowledge that you have acquired life truly goes on in terms of whether whatever you have learned you have tried to live that also life moves ahead depending upon the condition that whatever the sense of mission you have achieved and whatever is the sense of ambition that you nurture whether there is any ongoing co ordination between your sense of mission and your sense of ambition if you will have faith in these things then marks will automatically follow you and you will never have to chase marks it is the knowledge that is going to be of use to you in life so are skill self confidence and determination you tell me you must be having a family doctor to whom all the members of your family must be going whenever needed there would not be a single person in your family who might have asked that family doctor as to how many marks did he score while passing his exam none could have raised this question all of you would have thought that as a doctor he was good you were finding relief in his treatment and thus you started taking his services regularly when you have to fight a big law suit and you go to a lawyer to engage his services do you look at the mark sheet of that lawyer you only look at his experience his knowledge and the graph of his success and therefore this burden of hankering for marks hinders us sometimes from going in the right direction but that does not mean that i m implying that you don t have to study at all studies are definitely useful for testing our own mettle to know where i stood yesterday and where i stand today but this also happens sometimes and if you analyse minutely the journey of your own life you will realise that if you start running after marks you will look for the shortest ways and will identify a few selected things and focus on those only but if something comes from outside those few things you had touched upon a question comes which is outside the bunch of selected questions that you had prepared you will be find yourself slipping to the rock bottom if you have pursuit of knowledge as your focal point then by itself you try to acquire and attain a lot more however if you concentrate and focus only on getting marks then you gradually go on limiting yourself and confine yourself to certain areas for earning more marks thus you may find that despite becoming brilliant in passing the exams you have sometimes failed in life richa ji had also mentioned about pratispardha meaning competition with others it is a huge psychological battle in reality it is not the competition with others that takes us ahead in life but it is competing with ourselves or anuspardha which takes our life forward how can tomorrow be made better than yesterday how can a future occasion be used to improve upon the past results to make myself instantly clear i shall cite an example from the field of sports it is a feature in the life of most of the successful players that they compete with themselves let us take the example of mr sachin tendulkar he kept on breaking his own records consecutively and consistently for about twenty years everytime surpassing and outdoing himself and thus continuously forging ahead what a wonderful journey of life he has had only because he followed the route of competing with himself rather than competing with others friends in every field of life and when taking exams if you were able to study peacefully for two hours earlier then are you now able to do so for three hours if you couldn t wake up at the decided time in the morning and were thus delayed now can you get up early on time you couldn t sleep earlier due to exam tension are you able to sleep now put yourself to test and you ll find that a defeat in competition with others results in frustration disappointment despair and jealousy but anuspardha or competition with self leads to self analysis and introspection and makes our determination stronger and more resolute and when we prevail over ourselves then the motivation to do better becomes innate you don t need any external sources of energy that energy is generated from within on its own if i have to put it in a simple language then i would say that when you compete with someone else there are three broad possibilities that arise first that you are much better than him second that you are much worse than him and the third that you are equal to him if you are better than your competitor then you will become complacent as you will be filled with over confidence if you perform poorly against him you will become distressed and disappointed will be filled with envy that will devour and consume you and if you are equal to your competitor then you will never feel the need to improve life will just go on at its own pace therefore i urge you to engage in anuspardha or competition with self you must focus on how to improve upon your past performance and how to perform even better and you ll witness for yourself the positive change that it will bring about in you shriman s sunder ji has expressed his feelings on the role of parents he says that during exams parents have a vital role to play he further writes my mother was not educated yet she would sit by me and ask me to solve problems in mathematics she would then compare answers and thus be of great help to me she would help me rectify errors my mother did not clear the class 10 exam yet without her aid it would have been impossible for me to pass the cbse exam sunder ji what you say is absolutely correct and you must have observed today also that women are a majority amongst those who ask me questions or send in suggestions mothers who are consciously aware of and actively alert to their children s future play a big role in assuaging the atmosphere at home i shall urge parents to lay emphasis on just three points acceptance mentoring and sharing time accept things as they are whatever capabilities you posses use these to mentor your children and howsoever occupied you might be spare time for them be with them once you learn to accept maximum number of problems will be solved there and then every parent must be experiencing this expectation on the part of parents and teachers is the root cause of the problem acceptance brings about new avenues in finding solutions to problems expectations make the path difficult accepting a certain state provides us with the opportunity of opening up newer vistas just accept things as they are you will feel much lighter we keep deliberating on the heavy weight of our tiny tots school bags but there are times when i feel that expectations and aspirations on the part of parents are far too heavier compared to those school bags once many years ago one of our acquaintances was admitted to a hospital following a heart attack former m p purushottam mavlankar son of india s first lok sabha speaker ganesh dada mavlankar had come to the hospital to see him i was present there and i saw that he did not ask a single question on the state of his health he just sat down with no reference to the ailment or to the situation he started cracking jokes and lightened the atmosphere in a matter of just a few minutes in a way we terrify a patient with constant references to his ailment i would like to convey to parents that we do exactly the same with our children have you ever thought of creating an atmosphere of joy and laughter for children during exams see it for yourself the whole ambience will be transformed i have received an incredible phone call the gentleman does not wish to reveal his name when you listen to the call you will come to know why he does not want to identify himself namaskar pradhan mantriji i cannot divulge my name because of something that i did in my childhood once when i was young i had made an attempt to cheat in my exams and i started preparing most thoroughly for that i tried to explore and find out various methods of copying and wasted a lot of time because of that i could have very well secured the same marks by devoting that time to studying which i wasted while pondering how to copy moreover when i tried to use unfair means to pass the exam i got caught and a lot of my friends around me also had to undergo distress because of me what you say is right these shortcut ways become the reason for using unfair means there are times when not having enough confidence in oneself makes one crave to peep into a fellow student s answer sheet may be just to confirm if one has written the correct answer sometimes it happens that our own answer is correct and the other s answer is wrong but we somehow believe that the other s actually wrong answer is the right one which leads to our own undoing as well thus unfair means lead us nowhere to cheat is to be cheap so please do not cheat cheating makes you bad so stay away from it time and again you must have heard advisories on staying away from unfair means i am reiterating the same once again look at the scourge of cheating copying and such unfair means from any angle and in any form it is surely going to drag you into the abyss of failure in life over and above that if the invigilator catches you cheating during the exam you will be utterly ruined and suppose you are not caught even then your own conscience will be burdened for lifetime when the time will come to counsel your own children you will not be able to look them clearly in the eye burdened as you will be with your own sense of guilt and once you are habituated to using unfair means you will never feel the desire to actually learn anything in life where will you reach then it is as if you are yourself digging holes in your pathways and i have seen that there are people who squander so much of their talent invest their entire creativity in finding ingenious ways and means in designing unfair methods if one devotes the same time and the same creativity in addressing issues pertaining to exams one would never require any unfair means in the first place results that you achieve through your own hard work and diligence will invest you with a phenomenal and extra ordinary self confidence now listen to this phone call which i have received namaskar pradhan mantri ji my name is monica and since i am a class 12th student i wanted to ask you a couple of questions regarding the board exams my first question is what can we do to reduce the stress that builds up during our exams and my second question is why are exams all about work and no play thank you during exam days if i talk about sports and games your teachers your parents will be angry with me what kind of a prime minister is this who is asking children to come out and play during exams they might say people generally nurse the notion that if students indulge in sporting activities they become careless about their studies this notion is basically unfounded it is the root cause of this problem if one has to achieve holistic development the fact is that there exists a huge world a life beyond books and this precisely is the time to learn living that life also if someone says let me finish with all exams first i will play and do other things later well that is impossible this is the time for moulding one s life this is what upbringing is all about as a matter of fact in my opinion three things are crucial proper rest the other is the requisite amount of sleep the third is the body which is a major component way beyond mental activity other parts of the body too require physical activity with so much to do have you ever thought of spending a couple of moments gazing at the sky looking with wonder at the flora around you lightening your spirits a bit you will notice that you will return to your study room and be amongst your books with a renewed freshness whatever you are doing take a break have a stroll outside enter the kitchen look for something that you relish to eat munch on your favourite biscuit if possible tell or listen jokes and laugh for a while if only for five minutes give yourself a break you will feel the onset of a certain ease in your work i do not know if everyone likes this or not but i am saying it out of personal experience deep breathing during these times is very beneficial it relaxes you and for deep breathing you do not need to confine yourself to your room just be under the open sky go to the roof top do deep breathing for five minutes and return to your studies you will experience relaxation in your body a relaxed body equally relaxes your mental organs some of you feel like studying more and more keeping awake for late hours in the night no ensure adequate sleep for the body that is required it will help you avoid wastage of study time it will enhance your ability to study well your concentration will increase you will feel a certain freshness your overall efficiency will rise by leaps and bounds when i address election rallies sometimes i suffer from a sore throat or a hoarse voice once a folk singer came to meet me he asked me how many hours do you sleep i asked him if he was a doctor he said no but it is linked with your voice problem brought on by delivering so many election speeches only when you get adequate sleep your vocal chords will be able to rest fully well i had never given a thought to a possible connection between my sleep my speeches and my voice it was as if he had given me a herbal panacea actually we should understand the importance of these things it will surely benefit you but this does not mean that you keep sleeping all the time some might remark that since the prime minister has said so just keep sleeping there is no need to wake up and study please do not do that else your family members will be displeased with me and when your mark sheet arrives if they are not happy with that they will not see you but only me so avoid doing that and hence i will say p for prepare and p for play one who plays blossoms the person who plays shines this is a wonderful remedy for maintaining the vigour of the mind brain and body anyway young friends you are engrossed in preparing for your exams and here i am engaging you in matters close to my heart of course it is quite possible that my words this morning will act as a relaxant for you in the same breath i will add that do not let these remarks of mine be a burden on you do it only if you can if you cannot do it please do not do it else this too will weigh heavily on you just as i advise your parents not to be burdensome to you the same applies to me too keeping your resolve in mind with confidence in yourself set out for your exams my best wishes to your in order to clear a test treat the test as a festive occasion you will never feel a test a test again make headway with this mantra my dear countrymen on 1st february 2017 indian coast guard is

achieved through their dedication and service at the grassroots level this time there has been a good representation of the tribal community and people associated with tribal life among the padma awardees tribal life is different from the hustle and bustle of the cities its challenges are also different despite this tribal societies are always ready to preserve their traditions efforts are also made to preserve and research aspects related to tribal communities similarly many great personalities who have worked on tribal languages like toto ho kui kuvi and manda have received padma

ri singhbor kurka long muni venkatappa and mangal kanti rai are just a few of the names that are being discussed all around friends many padma awardees are those friends among us who always kept the

for whom they are working is the biggest award for them the pride of our countrymen has risen by honouring such dedicated people i may not be able to take the names of all the padma awardees here but i definitely request you to know in detail about the inspirational life of these padma awardees and tell others as well friends today when we are discussing our republic day during the azadi ka amrit mahotsav i will also mention an interesting book here a very interesting subject has been discussed in this book which i received a few weeks ago the name of this book is india the mother of democracy and it has many excellent essays india is the largest democracy in the world and we indians are also proud of the fact that our country is also the mother of democracy democracy is in our veins it is in our culture it has been an integral part of our work for centuries by nature we are a democratic society dr ambedkar had compared the buddhist monks union to the indian parliament he described it as an institution where there were many rules for motions resolutions quorum voting and counting of votes babasaheb believed that lord buddha must have got inspiration from the political systems of that time there is a small but famous village in tamil nadu utirmerur here an inscription of 1100 1200 years ago surprises the whole world this rock edict is like a mini constitution it has been explained in detail how the gram sabha should be conducted and what the procedure for selection of its members shall be another example of democratic values in the history of our country is the anubhav mandapam of lord basaveshwara of the 12thcentury here free debate and discussion were encouraged you will be surprised to know that it is even before the magna carta the republican traditions of the kakatiya dynasty kings of warangal were also very famous the bhakti movement furthered the culture of democracy in western india an article has also been included in the book on the democratic spirit of the sikh panth which throws light on the decisions taken by the consensus of guru nanak dev ji the book also has good information on community driven and consensus driven decision making in oraon and munda tribes of central india after reading this book you will feel how the spirit of democracy has been flowing in every part of the country for centuries as the mother of democracy we should constantly think deeply about this topic discuss it and also inform the world this will further strengthen the spirit of democracy in the country my dear countrymen if i ask you what is common between yoga day and our different types of coarse grains millets then you might think what is this comparison if i say that both have a lot in common you will be surprised in fact the united nations has taken the decision of both international yoga day and international year of millets after india s proposal secondly yoga is also related to health and millets also play an important role in health the third thing is more important a revolution is on the way because of public participation in both campaigns just as people have made yoga and fitness a part of their lives by taking active participation on a large scale similarly people are adopting millets on a large scale people are now making millets a part of their diet a huge impact of this change is also visible on the one hand the small farmers who traditionally used to produce millets are very excited they are very happy that the world has now started understanding the importance of millets on the other hand fpos and entrepreneurs have started efforts to market millets and make them available to people a resident of nandyal district of andhra pradesh k v rama subba reddy ji left a well paying job for the sake of millets the taste of millets made by his mother s hands was such that he started a millet processing unit in his village subba reddy ji also explains the benefits of millets to the people and also makes it easily available sharmila oswal a resident of kenad village near alibaug in maharashtra has been contributing in a unique way in the production of millets for the last 20 years she is imparting training in smart agriculture to farmers her efforts have not only increased the yield of millets but also increased the income of the farmers if you get a chance to visit raigarh in chhattisgarh you must visit the millets cafe here items like chilla dosa momos pizza and manchurian are becoming very popular in this millets cafe which started a few months back may i ask you one more thing you must have heard the word entrepreneur but have you heard milletpreneurs milletpreneurs of odisha are in the limelight these days a self help group of about 1500 women of the tribal district sundergarh is associated with the odisha millets mission here women are making everything from millets to cookies rasgulla gulab jamun and even cakes due to their great demand in the market the income of women is also increasing the aland bhootai aland bhutai millets farmers producer company started work last year under the supervision of the indian institute of millets research in kalaburgi karnataka people are liking the khakra biscuits and laddoos here in karnataka s bidar district women associated with the hulsoor millet producer company are cultivating millets as well as preparing their flour through this their earnings have also increased a lot farmers from 12 states have joined the fpo of chhattisgarh s sandeep sharma who is associated with natural farming this fpo of bilaspur is making 8 types of millets flour and their dishes friends today g 20 summit events are going on in every corner of india and i am happy that in every corner of the country wherever the g 20 summit is being held nutritious and tasty dishes made from millets are included in it dishes like bajra khichdi poha kheer and roti as well as ragi based payasam puri and dosa are also served here health drinks cereals and noodles made from millets were showcased in the millets exhibitions at all g20 venues indian missions around the world are also making a lot of efforts to increase their popularity you can imagine that this effort of the country and the increasing demand of millets in the world is going to give strength to our small farmers it gives joy to me to see that the variety of new things that have started being made from millets today is being liked equally by the young generation i also congratulate the listeners of mann ki baat for such a wonderful start to the international year of millets and for relentlessly taking it forward my dear countrymen what comes to your mind when someone talks about the tourist hub goa naturally as soon as the name of goa is referred to first of all the beautiful coastline beaches and favourite food items come to mind but something happened in goa this month which is in the headlines today in mann ki baat i want to share this with all of you this event happened in goa purple fest this fest was organized in panaji from 6 to 8 january this was a unique effort in itself for the welfare of the divyangs how big an occasion purple fest was you can all guess from the fact that more than 50 thousand brothers and sisters of ours participated in it the people who came here were thrilled about the fact that they could now enjoy the miramar beach to the fullest in fact miramar beach has become one of the accessible beaches of goa for our divyang brothers and sisters along with a cricket tournament table tennis tournament marathon competition a deaf blind convention was also organized here apart from the unique bird watching program a film was also shown here special arrangements were made for this so that all our divyang brothers and sisters and children could enjoy it to the fullest one special thing about purple fest was the participation of the private sector of the country in it products which are divyang friendly were showcased on their behalf many efforts were seen in this fest to raise awareness about the welfare of the divyangs for making purple fest a success i congratulate all the people who participated in it along with this i also congratulate those volunteers who came together to work day and night to organize this i have full faith that such campaigns will prove to be very effective in realizing our vision of accessible india my dear countrymen now in mann ki baat i will talk on a topic in which you will feel joy and pride and your mind will say wow what a joy one of the oldest science institutions in the country the indian institute of science bangalore i e iisc is presenting a wonderful example in mann ki baat i have discussed earlier how the two great personalities of india jamsetji tata and swami vivekananda have been the inspiration behind the establishment of this institution and a matter of joy and pride for us is that in the year 2022 there have been a total of 145 patents in the name of this institute this means two patents every five days this record is amazing in itself i would also like to congratulate the team of iisc for this success friends today india s ranking is 7th in patent filing and 5th in trademarks talking about patents only there has been an increase of about 50 percent in the last five years in the global innovation index too india s ranking has improved tremendously and now it has reached 40th position while in 2015 india was behind even the 80th position in the global innovation index i want to tell you one more interesting thing for the first time in the last 11 years in india the number of domestic patent filing was seen more than foreign filing it also shows the growing scientific prowess of india friends we all know that knowledge is paramount in the global economy of the 21st century i believe that the dream of india s techade will definitely be fulfilled on the strength of our innovators and their patents with this we all will be able to take full advantage of world class technology and products prepared in our own country my dear countrymen i saw a post on namoapp by engineer vijay ji from telangana in this vijayji has written about e waste vijay ji requests that i discuss this in mann ki baat earlier too in this programme we have talked about waste to wealth i e kachre se kanchan but come today let s discuss e waste related to this friends today devices like mobile phone laptop tablet have become common in every household their number will be in billions across the country today s latest devices are also future s e waste whenever someone buys a new device or replaces one s old device it becomes necessary to keep in mind whether it is discarded properly or not if e waste is not disposed of properly it can also harm our environment but if done carefully it can become a great force in the circular economy of recycle and reuse it was mentioned in a united nations report that 50 million tonnes of e waste is being thrown every year can you guess how much even if the weight of all the commercial planes that have been built in the history of mankind is combined it will not equal the amount of e waste being released it is like every second 800 laptops are being thrown away you will be amazed to know that about 17 types of precious metals can be extracted from this e waste through different processes this includes gold silver copper and nickel so utilizing e waste is no less than making kachre ko kanchan today there is no dearth of start ups that are doing innovative work in this direction at present around 500 e waste recyclers are associated with this sector and many new entrepreneurs are also being associated with it this sector has also given direct employment to thousands of people e parisaraa of bengaluru is engaged in one such effort it has developed an indigenous technology for extracting precious metals from printed circuit boards similarly ecoreco working in mumbai has developed a system to collect e waste through a mobile app attero recycling of roorkee uttarakhand has obtained many patents in this field worldwide it has also earned a lot of awards by preparing its own e waste recycling technology tonnes of e waste are being collected in bhopal through a mobile app and the website kabadiwala there are many such examples all these are helping to make india a global recycling hub but there is also an essential condition for the success of such initiatives that is people have to be made aware about safe useful methods of disposal of e waste those working in the field of e waste say that at present only 15 17 percent e waste is being recycled every year my dear countrymen today there is a lot of talk about climate change and conservation of biodiversity all over the world we have been continuously talking about india s concrete efforts in this direction you will also be very happy to know the work that india has done for its wetlands some listeners might be wondering what wetlands are wetland sites means those places where water remains accumulated throughout the year on marshy soil like land a few days later on february 2 it is world wetlands day wetlands are very important for the existence of our earth because many birds and animals depend on them along with enriching biodiversity they also ensure flood control and ground water recharge many of you must be knowing that ramsar sites are such wetlands which are of international importance wetlands may be there in any country but they have to fulfill many criteria only then are they declared as ramsar sites ramsar sites should have 20 000 or more water birds it is important to have a large number of local fish species on 75 years of independence during the amrit mahotsav i would like to share with you some good information related to ramsar sites now the total number of ramsar sites in our country has increased to 75 whereas before 2014 there were only 26 ramsar sites in the country for this the local community deserves congratulations who have preserved this biodiversity it is also a tribute to

countrymen namaskar of late news of abundant rainfall has been steadily coming in at places we are hearing of rising concerns on account of excessive showers at some places people are anxiously waiting for the rains to begin the vastness and diversity of india in fact at times even rains play hide seek through partiality laced likes dislikes but why should we blame the rains after all it was humankind that chose the path of conflict with nature and consequently earnt her periodic wrath and that is why it becomes our collective responsibility let us be lovers of nature protectors of nature conservers of nature and thus ensure spontaneous balance in her myriad bounty come to think of it recently an incident pertaining to a natural disaster attracted global attention leaving every heart mind perturbed all of you must have watched it on t v in thailand a team of 12 teenaged football players and their coach went on an excursion to a cave usually it takes a few hours to enter and exit that cave but destiny had different plans that day barely had they entered deep into the cave that a sudden heavy downpour caused water logging at the inlet of the cave their exit was completely blocked not able to find a way out they perched themselves a top a mound inside the cave not for a day or two but an entire 18 days one can only imagine the predicament of these teenagers in the face of death where every second was fraught with danger on the one hand they were struggling against all odds on the other the world over humanity joined hands in expressing the noblest the most righteous of human virtues the world over people prayed for the safe secure exit of these children no stone was left unturned to trace their where abouts their well being and their rescue their timely evacuation was of a prime concern since the heavy monsoon would have delayed rescue attempts by a few months anyway the good news of their safe exit spread a sigh of relief a sense of inner calm but i feel like viewing the entire sequence of events from another perspective i e how the operation was conducted the sense of responsibility commitment prevailing at every level was astonishing the government their parents family members media citizens of that country each one of them displayed an awe inspiring sense of peace and patience all of them came together as a team to accomplish their mission i feel the self control exercised by each one of them in conduct is worth understanding and emulating it is not that the parents were not aggrieved it is not that the mothers eyes had ceased to be moist their patience their restraint in fact the calm composure exercised by the entire society is commendable worth following during the operation a sailor from thailand navy sacrificed his life the whole world is be wildered at the way they held on with courage and patience without losing hope despite the odds against them in the water logged dark cave this proves that when humanity stands together it creates wonders what is certainly required is focusing on your goal with a calm steady demeanour and the will to strive a few days ago the country s beloved poet neeraj ji left us forever neeraj ji was blessed with a special quality it was a combination of hope faith a firm resolve and self confidence every word of neeraj ji s work can instill a lot of strength inspiration in us indians he wrote the darkness shall be dispelled whether you brew up storms or make lightening strike now that the lamp has been lit the darkness shall be dispelled my heartfelt respectful tributes to neeraj ji usually the months of july and august are very important for farmers and the youth this is the time which is peak season for colleges like satyam hundreds of thousands of youth leave schools to join colleges whereas february and march get consumed in exams papers and answers april may are meant for enjoying vacations followed by results and thereafter shaping a course for one s life through career choices july is the month when the youth step into a new phase of life where the focus shifts from questions and veers towards cut offs the attention of students steers from home to hostel students submit themselves to the tutelage of professors vis a vis the shadow of their parents i firmly believe that my young friends must be enthusiastic happy on the commencement of their college life leaving home for the first time moving out of one s village coming out of a protective environment amounts to taking charge of the course of one s life this multitude of young people leave their homes for the first time to chart a new direction for their lives some students might have joined their respective colleges and some must be about to join all i would like to say to you is be calm enjoy life seek inner happiness in life there is no alternative to books one has to study yet one s bent of mind should be towards discovering new things old friends are invaluable childhood friends are precious but selecting making maintaining new friendships is a task that requires immense prudence keep learning something new such as newer skills and languages young people who leave their homes for the sake of studies should discover their new places know more about the people language culture tourism facets related to them my best wishes to all the young people about to begin a new innings referring to the college season reminds me of someone i saw in the news recently how asharam choudhury a student from an extremely poor family in madhya pradesh overcame life s many challenges to achieve success in his maiden attempt he cracked the entrance exam for mbbs at aiims jodhpur his father earns his daily bread by waste picking i congratulate him on his success there are many such instances of students from deprived families who through sheer determination perseverance overcame all odds and stood out to be beacons of inspiration to others examples such as prince kumar of delhi whose father is a dtc bus driver abhay gupta of kolkata who studied on foothpaths under street lights bitiya afreen sheikh of ahmedabad whose father drives an auto rickshaw nagpur s daughter khushi whose father is a school bus driver karthik of haryana whose father is a watchman or ramesh sahu of jharkhand whose father is a brick kiln labourer or gurgaon s divyang angel anushka panda who suffers from a hereditary disorder called spinal muscular atrophy all of them overcame each every obstacle through their firm resolve and zeal attaining success for the world to see if we look around we can see many such examples any commendable incident from any part of the country infuses my heart with energy and inspires me and when i mention the glorious journey of these youth i am reminded of neeraj ji s line which sum up the raison d etre of life neeraj ji has said how i wish to make the sky listen to the song of the earth how i wish to inspire every strand of darkness to come to the radiance of light and i wish to conquer the might of the sword with the fragrance of flowers and to awaken the mountains with the sweetness of songs my dear countrymen a few days ago i happened to glance through a news item it said two youths make modi s dream come true on reading further i came to know how our youngsters put in efforts to transform the lives of the common man by making smart and creative use of technology it so happened that once i was interacting with indian youth in san jose town of america hailed as a technology hub i had appealed to those young people to think over how could they use their talent to india s benefit and do something in that direction whenever they found time i had made an appeal to change brain drain into brain gain two it professionals from rae bareilly yogesh sahu ji and rajneesh bajpayee ji accepted my challenge and made a unique attempt with their joint efforts yogesh ji and rajneesh ji have developed a smartgaonapp by utilizing their professional skills this app is not only connecting the villagers with the whole world but now they can obtain any information on their own mobile phones residents of the village taudhakpur in rae bareilly village chief district magistrate cdo and every one joined in to create awareness amongst the masses this app is actually bringing in a digital revolution in the village with the help of this app it has since become easier to record track and monitor developmental work being done in the village this app contains phone directory news section events list health centre and information centre of the village this app is very useful for the farmers and the grammar feature of the app and fact rate among the farmers functions like a market place for their products if you look into this incident minutely one thing will strike you and that is the young man living in america adhering to that country s life style and ideology who left india many years ago but knows the finer details about his village knows about the challenges and still is emotionally attached to his village this seems to be the reason as to how he could develop this app which is most suited to needs of the village a sense of belonging towards the village and towards one s roots and also a spirit to show and do something is naturally there in each and every indian but sometimes because of time sometimes because of distance and at times because of situations that spirit gets faded but just with a touch of a tiny spark everything re emerges which takes one back to old memories we should also check if such a thing has happened in our case too whether circumstances situations distances have made us alien whether dust has gathered over our determinations do think santoshji many many thanks for your phone call actually pandharpur wari is an amazing journey in itself friends ashadhi ekadashi which fell on 23rd july is celebrated as a day of grand transformation of pandharpur wari pandharpur is a holy town in solapur district in maharashtra about 15 20 days before ashadhi ekadashi warkari or pilgrims start the pandharpur yatra on foot this yatra journey is known as wari and lakhs of warkaris join this wooden foot wear or padukas of great saints like saint gyaneshwar and saint tukaram are placed in a palki and pilgrims begin their pilgrimage chanting vitthal vitthal pilgrims go to have a darshan of vitthal who is also known as vithoba or pandurang lord vitthal safeguards the interests of the poor the deprived ones and the ones who are suffering people from maharashtra karnataka goa andhra pradesh telengana have deep devotion and respect for vitthal visiting vithoba temple in pandharpur and its grandeur beauty and spiritual bliss is a unique experience in itself i request the listeners of mann ki baat to visit pandharpur wari at least once whenever they get a chance innumerable saints like gyaneshwar namdev eknath ram dass tukaram are relevant even today in educating the masses they are imparting energy to fight against superstition in each and every corner across the country may they be compositions like bharud hkk m or abhang vhkax we get a great message of amity love and brotherhood we get the mantra to enable the society to fight against blind faith through devotion and bhakti these were the people who at times restrained and corrected the society even showed a mirror and ensured that old evil traditions get eradicated from the society and that people inculcated a culture of compassion equality and righteousness our mother india is a land full of gems and treasures and the tradition of these great saints that adorned our land are at the same level as the great men who dedicated and sacrificed their lives for our mother india one such great man has been lok manya tilak who has left a very deep impression on the hearts of a large number of indians we remember and pay our homage to tilak ji on his birth anniversary on 23rd july and his death anniversary on 1st august lokmanya tilak was full of courage and self confidence he had the courage to show a mirror to the british about their wrong doings the british were so afraid of lok manya tilak that they tried to charge him of sedition thrice in two decades this is no small thing i want to narrate an interesting incident to the countrymen which is connected with lok manya tilak and his statue in ahmedabad when in october 1916 lok manya tilak ji came to ahmedabad more than 40 000 people that time gave him a welcome and during that very visit sardar vallabh bhai patel had a chance to talk to him sardar vallabh bhai patel was greatly impressed by lok manya tilakji when on august 1 1920 lok manya tilakji passed away patel ji had decided then itself that he would build his statue in ahmedabad sardar vallabh bhai patel was elected the mayor of ahmedabad municipal corporation and he immediately selected victoria garden as a venue for lok manya tilak s memorial and this was the very victoria garden which was named after the british queen the british were naturally not happy with this and the collector continually kept denying permission but sardar saheb was also sardar saheb after all he was persistent and had remarked that he might have to give up on his post but lok manya tilakji s statue would certainly be built there finally the statue got built and sardar saheb got it unveiled by none other than mahatma gandhi on 28th february 1929 and the most interesting point is that during that inaugural ceremony revered bapuji said that with the coming of sardar patel ahmedabad municipal corporation has not only got a man but it has got the strength on the basis of which building the statue of tilakji has become possible and my dear countrymen the speciality about this statue is that this is a rare statue of tilakji in which he is sitting in a chair and in this swaraj is our birthright swaraj hamara janma sidhha adhikar hai is inscribed right below tilakji s statue and this all happened during the period of british rule tradition of publicly celebrating ganesh utsav was also initiated with the efforts of lok manya tilakji the celebration of ganesh utsav publicly had become an effective medium in promoting a spirit of social awakening integration amity and equality among the masses besides projecting a sense of dedication and festivity in them this was the period when there was a need for people to get united in the fight against the british these festivals by breaking the barriers of casteism and communalism served the purpose of uniting all such events gained more popularity with the passage of time thus it becomes clear that our younger generations still care for the brave heroes of our ancient past its heritage and history today you can see ganesh pandals in almost every street of various cities all families in that street collectively organize these pandals this is an excellent chance for our youth wherein they can learn qualities of leadership and organization and inculcate these in themselves my dear countrymen i had requested last time too and now while remembering lokmanya tilak i will once again urge all of you to celebrate ganesh utsav with great enthusiasm and fervour whole heartedly but insist on keeping these celebrations eco friendly right from ganesh idol to all decorative material everything ought to be eco friendly and i will appreciate that separate competitions be organized in each city prizes be awarded for these and i will like that eco friendly items related to ganesh utsav are displayed for wider publicity on my gov and narendra modi app i will surely send your ideas and efforts to the people lokmanya tilak evoked self confidence amongst our countrymen and gave the slogan swaraj is our birth right and i shall have it today is the time to say that good governance is our birth right and we will have it every indian should have access to good governance and positive results of development it is the factoring in of this outreach that will create a new india after 50 years of tilak s birth on the same day i e on july 23 another son of mother india was born who sacrificed his life so that his countrymen could breathe freely in an atomsphere of freedom i am talking about none other than chandrasekhar azad where will you find a young man in india who will not be inspired listening to these lines sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mein hai dekhna hai zor kitna baazu e qaatil mein hai the desire for martyrdom is now in our hearts let us see the strength in the arms of my executioner these lines inspired many young people like ashfaq ullah khan bhagat singh chandrashekhar azad and many others azad s courage and passion for freedom inspired the youth of the day chandrashekhar azad put his life on the stake but he never bowed in front of the foreign rule it was my privilege and good fortune that i had the opportunity of going to chandrasekhar azad s native village of alirajpur in madhya pradesh i had the opportunity to pay homage in chandrashekhar azad park in allahabad chandrasekhar azad ji was a brave man who did not wish to die by the bullet of foreigners he wished to fight for independence as a free man and if he had to die he wished to remain a free man this is what was so special about him once again i bow and pay tributes to the two great sons of bharat mata lokmanya tilakji and chandrasekhar azad ji just a few days ago in the junior under 20 world athletics championship in finland india s brave daughter and a farmer daughter hima das made history by winning the gold medal in the 400 meter race event ekta bhyan another daughter of the country in response to my letter has emailed me from indonesia where she is now preparing

herself all the more stronger to perform this grand feat another divyang yogesh qathuniaji has won the gold medal in the discus throw in para athletics grand prix in berlin and in the process bettered the world record along with sundar singh gurjar who also won the gold medal in javelin i salute ekta bhyanji yogesh qathuniaji and sundar singh ji all of you for your fortitude and passion and congratulate you may you go further than these successes keep on playing and keep on blooming my dear countrymen the month of august is significant because it is filled with historically important

the catastrophic corona global pandemic amidst that it will not be appropriate on my part to reflect on anything else but first of all i extend a heartfelt apology to all countrymen and i strongly feel from the core of my heart that you will forgive me since certain decisions had to be taken resulting in myriad hardships for you and when it comes to my underprivileged brothers and sisters they must be wondering on the kind of prime minister they have who has pushed them to the brink my wholehearted apologies especially to them it is possible that many are annoyed with me for their confinement in their homes i fully understand your situation i can feel what you are going through but in order to battle corona in a country of 130 crore people such as india there was no other option the fight against corona is one between life and death itself we have to win and that is why such strong measures had to be resorted to no one wants to go that way looking at what the world is going through this was the only way left after all the safety of you and your families has to be ensured once again i apologize for any inconvenience any hardship caused to you friends we have an adage evam evam vikar api tarunha saadhyate sukham which means an illness and its scourge should be nipped in the bud itself later when it becomes incurable its treatment is very difficult today the whole of india every indian is doing just that brothers sisters mothers and the elderly corona virus has incarcerated the world it is posing a challenge to knowledge science the rich and the poor the strong and the weak alike it is not confined to any nation s borders nor does it make distinction of region or season this virus has in a way obstinately picked up the gauntlet to annihilate the human race and that is why humankind will have to rise unitedly in the resolve to exterminate it some may feel that by complying with the lockdown they are helping others this is a misconception this lockdown is a means to protect yourself you have to protect yourself and your family for the next many days you have to continue displaying this patience abide by the lakshman rekha friends i know that no one wants to overstep the law and break rules wilfully but there are some who are doing so since they are not trying to understand the gravity of the matter to them i will say that if they don t comply with the lockdown rule it will be difficult to save ourselves from the scourge of the corona virus the world over many people nursed this delusion all of them are regretting now friends we are familiar with our adage aarogyam param bhagyam swasthyam sarwaarth sadhanam which means good health is the greatest fortune health is the only way to happiness in the world in that backdrop those breaking the rules are playing with their lives friends in this war there are many soldiers who are fighting the corona virus not in the confines of their homes but outside their homes these are our

enter wearing their dress one could not make out if it was a doctor or a ward boy or nurse we would obey their instructions fully there we did not face even one percent problem pm you come across as someone with immense self confidence ak sir i am perfect yes i have earlier undergone a knee surgery also even then i am perfect pm no but since your entire family went through a bad time including the young sixteen year old ak and sir it was time for his icse papers we said no that can be thought of later if life stays on all papers will be managed not to worry pm modi that is true your experience in life came to be of use in this crisis and imparted confidence as well as courage to the entire family ashok kapoor yes we all went there the entire family we supported each other and though we did not meet we would talk on the phone we wouldn t meet but the doctors took complete care of us to the maximum extent possible we are grateful to them for their compassion the staff nurses took full care of us pm modi let me extend my best wishes to you and your entire family ashok kapoor thank you ji thanks we are all very happy that i have spoken to you pm modi no it is a pleasure for us ashok kapoor even then sir i speak for all of us if it is needed to go anywhere to spread awareness or to do something we are ready at all times pm modi no in your own way do it in agra if someone is hungry feed him be empathetic to the poor and follow the rules you must explain to the people that your family was in the clutches of this disease but you managed to save your family by following the rules if everyone follows the rules then the country too will be saved ashok kapoor we sir modi sir we have shot our videos and sent them to the tv channels pm modi good ashok kapoor the channels have also telecast them so awareness can be spread in people and pm modi this should be streamed in social media also so they become popular ashok kapoor yes yes and in our colony where we live it is a neat and clean colony we have told everyone that look we have come back from quarantine so do not be afraid if anyone has a health scare go and get it tested and those who met should also get their tests done and remain protected by the mercy of god yes sir pm modi alright i wish everyone all the best friends we pray for the long life of ashok ji and his entire family as he mentioned without panicking following the right steps on time contacting doctors on time without getting afraid and by taking proper precautions we can defeat this pandemic friends to know the capability with which we are dealing with this pandemic at the medical level i also spoke to some doctors who are leading the front line in this battle their daily activity is synchronous with that of their patients we now joined by dr nitesh gupta from delhi pm modi hello doctor dr nitesh gupta hello sir pm modi namaste niteshji you are right there on the front so i want to know what is the mood of the rest of your colleagues in the hospitals tell us how is it dr nitesh gupta everyone s mood is upbeat your blessings are with everyone whatever cause you are supporting in the given hospital or whatever we are asking for in line treatment you are providing it all so we are engaged in exactly the same way just like the army battles on the border and our only duty is to get the patient back home after being cured pm modi you are right this is a war like situation and you all are managing a frontline dr nitesh gupta yes sir pm modi you must also be counselling the patient along with his treatment dr nitesh gupta yes sir that is the most important thing because the patient gets traumatized upon hearing what is happening with him they have to be explained that there is nothing to fear and post quarantine lasting 14 days he will be fine and return home for sure so far we have managed to send 16 such patients home pm modi so what comes across over all when you converse with such scared patients are they plagued by worries dr nitesh gupta they think mostly about what will happen next what will happen now it is because what they witness in the outside world with morbid mortality rates and wonder if the same will happen to them so we explain to them which one of their afflictions will be cured during a particular time frame we counsel them that their case is very mild akin to a case with a common cold and since one gets well in five seven days they too will be fine after a similar period of convalescence then we will tell them that after tests which are bound to report as negative and then they can be send home so that s why we visit them repeatedly after intervals of two three four hours we meet them ask about their wellbeing they also feel comfortable throughout the day pm modi so they have their confidence restored after being scared initially dr nitesh gupta initially they are scared but when we have counselled and by the second or third day when they start recovering they also start believing that they can be cured pm modi but do all the doctors are imbued with the feeling that the work of rendering the greatest service in their lives has to be shouldered by them is this emotion shared by all of them dr nitesh gupta yes it is we keep our team motivated to the utmost extent that there is nothing to fear and there is no such thing that we should fear if we observe precautions thoroughly and explain these precautions to the patient that he is to follow then everything will be fine pm modi ok doctor a large amount of patients come to you and you are absolutely devoted to their cause it was nice talking to you but in this battle i m with you keep on fighting dr nitesh gupta we seek your blessings this is what we wish pm modi many good wishes bhaiya dr nitesh gupta sir thank you pm modi nitish ji plenty of plaudits to you due to efforts of people like you india will surely achieve victory in the battle against corona i urge you to take care of yourself take care of your loved ones take care of your family the world s experience tells us that in this illness the number of patients infected with it suddenly grows exponentially on account of this sudden rise we have seen the best health systems crumble in order to ensure that india does not have to face such a situation we have to keep trying ceaselessly another doctor joins us from pune shriman doctor borse pm modi namaste doctor doctor namaste namaste pm modi you are working relentlessly in the true spirit of service to mankind is service to god i want to speak to you today on something that will be a message for our countrymen firstly a question that strikes the minds of many is when to contact doctors and when to go for the corona test as a doctor you have dedicated yourself completely in the service of patients your words carry weight i want to hear it from you doctor sir i am a professor at b j medical college pune and in pune there is a muncipal corporation hospital named naidu hospital it has a fully functional screening centre since januray 2020 here till date 16 covid 19 positive cases have been diagnosed and out of those 16 cases after due quarantine isolation and treatment 7 patients have been discharged sir and the remaining nine cases are also very stable and doing well despite the virus being inside their bodies they are getting well they are recovering out of the corona virus here the sample size is tiny sir only 16 cases but cases of the young population getting affected are coming to light and despite that the disease itself is not that serious a disease it s a mild disease and patients are successfully recovering and those remaining 9 people are also going to be well they are not going to deteriorate we are keeping a watch on them on a daily basis they are also going to be well in another 4 5 days from people who come here as suspects international travellers and those who come into contact with them we take a swab oropharyngeal and nasal if the nasal swab report is positive the patient is being admitted to the positive ward if negative we advise the patient on home quarantine how it is to be done at home after this advice they are sent home pm modi what do you explain to them while at home what aspects do you elucidate to them doctor sir even if one stays at home one has to stay quarantined there observing a 6 feet distance is mandatory secondly one has to use a mask and wash hands very frequently if you do not have sanitisation you can use simple soap and water to wash hands but you have to keep doing it frequently and while coughing or sneezing use a simple handkerchief to cough on so that droplets are not able to spread nor fall on the floor thus preventing hand contact and further spread we explain this sir the second thing is when they are supposed to be in a home quarantine they are not supposed to leave home at all during the current lockdown they ought to be home quarantined properly for a minimum of 14 days we are informing them this is our message to them sir pm modi fine doctor you are doing a great service and with selfless dedication your entire team is at work i firmly believe that all our patients there return home safely we shall win this battle it will be victory for the country with the help from all of you doctor sir we believe we shall overcome we shall win this battle pm modi doctor many good wishes to you thank you doctor thank you thank you sir friends all these people all these friends are persevering to the best extent possible to chase out this scourge what they tell us is not just for us to listen to it is to be practised in life in the truest spirit today when i witness the sacrifice perseverance and dedication on part of doctors i am reminded of the touching words of acharya charak while referring to doctors and it is so visible in doctor s lives today acharya charak had said na aatmarthan na api kaamartham atbhoot dayam prati vartate yat chikitsaym sa savarma iti vartate which means the one who strives for his patient s well being in the spirit of service and compassion with no desire monetary or otherwise is the greatest doctor friends today i salute the embodiment of humanity the nurse the selfless spirit of service with which you perform your duty is beyond compare it s a coincidence that the world is celebrating year 2020 as the international year of the nurse and midwife this goes back 200 years ago i e 1820 the year that is associated with the birth of florence nightingale who lent a new identity a new paradigm to the term service to humanity and the field of nursing taking it to newer heights dedicated to the spirit of service of every nurse in the world this year has come as a challenging examination for the entire nursing community i believe all of you will not only clear the exam successfully you will also save many lives we are able to fight a battle on such a massive scale only on account of the zeal and grit of frontline warriors like you be you a doctor a nurse a para medic aasha an anm worker sanitation worker the country is also concerned about your health keeping that in mind for around 20 lakhs colleagues from these fields the government has announced a health insurance cover of upto rs 50 lakhs so that in this battle you can lead the country with greater self confidence my dear countrymen in this battle against corona virus we have many examples of real heroes in the society people who are at the forefront even in these conditions on the narendra modi app the namo app niranjan sudhaakar hebbaale of bengaluuru has written that such people are daily life heroes and that is quite right too these are people due to whom our daily life runs smoothly just imagine if the water in your taps runs dry for just a day or there is a sudden power outage in your house at that time it is these daily life heroes who banish our troubles think about the small retail store in your neighbourhood in these troubled times he too is taking a great risk after all for whom isn t it because he wants to ensure that you do not face any difficulty in buying essential goods similar to that think about those drivers and workers who are continuing to work ceaselessly so that the nation s supply chain of essential goods is not disrupted you might have noticed that the government has kept the banking services open and those working in the banking sector are there at your service with full commitment and dedication leading us in this fight these services are not trivial at a time like this we cannot thank these bank personnel enough for their service many of our friends are engaged with e commerce companies as delivery personnel these people are continuing delivering grocery even in these trying times just think as you watch television during this lock down using the phone and internet even while being home bound someone is working hard to ensure that these services continue uninterrupted during this time many of you are able to make digital payments with ease many people are working hard to facilitate that these are the people who are bearing the burden of the country s work during this lock down on behalf of all countrymen today i wish to express my gratitude to all these people and request them that they follow all the safety precautions take care of themselves and their family members my dear countrymen i have come to know of some instances that some of those people who were suspected to have corona virus and asked to stay in home quarantine are being ill treated by others i am greatly pained to learn of these instances this is very unfortunate we need to understand that in the current circumstances we need to ensure social distance not human or emotional distance these people are not criminals they are merely suspected to be infected with the virus these people have isolated and quarantined themselves to protect other people from getting infected at many places people have taken their responsibilities very seriously they have quarantined themselves even when they were asymptomatic they did so because they had travelled abroad recently and were being doubly cautious they wanted to ensure that nobody else got infected by this virus so when people are behaving so responsibly it is unfair to ill treat them on the contrary they need to be shown sympathy and cooperation social distancing is the most effective way of fighting against corona virus but we have to understand that social distancing does not mean ending social interaction actually this is the time to give a new lease of life to all your existing social relationships to energise these relationships in a way this time teaches us to reduce emotional distance and increase social distance yashvardhan from kota have written on the namo app that they are increasing family bonding during the lock down they are playing cricket and board games with kids p reparing new dishes in the kitchen nirupama harsheya from jabalpur writes on the namo app that she finally got an opportunity to fulfil her wish to make a quilt on top of that she is also fulfilling her gardening hobby i also happened to read the posts of pareekshit from raipur aaryaman from gurugram and suraj from jharkhand and they have discussed about having an e reunion with their school friends their idea is very interesting it s possible that you too might not have gotten a chance to talk to your school and college mates for decades you too can try out this idea pratyush of bhubaneswar and vasudha of kolkata have mentioned that they are reading books that they had hitherto not been able to read i also saw on social media that many people took out musical instruments like table and veena that were lying unused for years and started practising on them you too can do that that will not only give you the joy of music but also take you on a trip down the memory lane in this crisis you have got a rare opportunity to not only connect with yourself but also with your passion you will also get an opportunity to connect with your old friends and with your family shashi ji from roorke has asked me on the namo app what do i do for my fitness during the lock down how do i observe the navaraatri fast in these circumstances let me reiterate that although i have urged you to avoid stepping out of your houses i have also given you an opportunity to take a look inwards at yourself this is your chance don t go out but go inside try to know yourself as far as the navaraatri fast is concerned that is between me and my faith and the supreme power as regards fitness i think that will be quite a lengthy topic so what i ll do is i ll upload some videos on this topic on the social media you can surely see those videos on the namo app what i do possibly can aid and inspire some of you but do remember that i am not a fitness expert i am also not a yoga teacher i am merely a practitioner i do concede however that some yogaasanaas have greatly benefited me it s possible that some of these tips might help you too during the lock down friends this battle against corona is unprecedented as well as challenging hence the decisions being taken during this time are unheard of in the history of the world the steps being taken by indians to stop the spread of corona the efforts that we are currently making will ensure that india conquers this corona pandemic the determination and restraint of each indian will also aid in facing this crisis in addition our sympathy for the poor should also be far greater our humanity stems from the fact that whenever we see a poor or hungry person we first try and feed him or her in this time of crisis we should think of their needs and india can do this these are a part of our values and culture my dear countrymen today every indian is confined to the home to ensure his or her own safety but in the times to come the very same indian will tear down all walls on the road to our progress and take the country forward stay at home with your family be careful and safe we need to win this battle and we will win we will meet in man ki baat again next month by then we should have overcome this crisis with this hope and this wish i thank you all mannkibaat begins with an important message by pm

through the Namo app and MyGov.",29-may-2022 my dear countrymen namaskar today once again through mann ki baat i have got an opportunity to meet you all millions of my family members i welcome all of you to mann ki baat a few days ago the country has made an achievement which inspires all of us instills a new confidence in india s prowess you must be feeling happy on hearing of the century of a batsman of team india on the cricket field but india has scored a century in another field and it is very special on the 5th of this month the number of unicorns in the country has reached the figure of 100 and you surely know that a unicorn is a start up worth at least seven and a half thousand crore rupees the total valuation of these unicorns is more than 330 billion dollars that is more than 25 lakh crore rupees certainly this is a matter of pride for every indian you will also be surprised to know that out of our total unicorns forty four came up last year not only that 14 more unicorns were formed anew in 3 4 months this year this means that even in this phase of the global pandemic our start ups have been creating wealth and value the average annual growth rate of indian unicorns is more than those of usa uk and many other countries analysts also say that in the coming years there will be a sharp spike in these numbers the good thing is that our unicorns are diversifying they are operating in many fields like e commerce fin tech ed tech bio tech another thing which i consider more important is that the world of start ups is reflecting the spirit of new india today india s start up ecosystem is not limited to just big cities entrepreneurs are emerging from smaller cities and towns as well this shows that in india the one who has an innovative idea can create wealth friends behind this success of the country the youth power of the land the talent and the government here all are putting in efforts together everyone is contributing but another thing that is important in the world of start ups is right mentoring that is right guidance a good mentor can take a start up to new heights can guide the founders in every way toward the right decision i am proud that there are many such mentors in india who have dedicated themselves to promote start ups sridhar vembu ji has recently received the padma award he himself is a successful entrepreneur but now he has also taken up upon himself the task of grooming other entrepreneurs shridhar ji has started his work from a rural area he is encouraging the rural youth to do something in this area staying in the village itself we also have people like madan padaaki who had created a platform named one bridge in 2014 to promote rural entrepreneurs today one bridge is present in more than 75 districts of southern and eastern india more than 9000 rural entrepreneurs associated with it are providing their services to rural consumers meera shenoy ji is also one such example she is doing remarkable work in the field of market linked skills training for rural tribal and disabled youth i have mentioned only a few names here but today there is no dearth of mentors among us it is a matter of great happiness for us that today a complete support system is evolving in the country for start ups i am sure that in the times to come we will get to see a new flight of progress in the start up world of india friends a few days ago i found an interesting and attractive thing which is full of colours of the creativity of the countrymen and their artistic talent it is a gift sent to me by self help group from thanjavur tamil nadu this gift bears the fragrance of indianness and the blessings of matri shakti a glimpse of her affection for me this is a special thanjavur doll which also has a gi tag i offer special thanks to the thanjavur self help group for sending me this gift imbued in the local culture in a way friends this thanjavur doll besides being beautiful that it is is also scripting a new saga of women empowerment women s self help groups stores and kiosks are also opening up in thanjavur because of this the lives of many poor families have changed with the help of such kiosks and stores women are now able to sell their products directly to the customers the initiative has been named tharagaigal kaivinai porutkal virpanai angadi the special thing is that 22 self help groups are associated with this initiative you would also be happy to know that these stores of women self help groups have opened at very prime locations in thanjavur women themselves are taking full responsibility of their upkeep as well apart from gi products like thanjaur doll and bronze lamp these women self help groups also craft toys mats and artificial jewellery due to such stores the sales of gi products as well as handicraft products have seen a significant rise through this campaign not only have the artisans got a fillip but the women are also getting empowered by a rise in their income i also urge the listeners of mann ki baat find out which women self help groups are working in your area you should also collect information about their products and use these products as much as possible by doing this you will not only help in increasing the income of the self help groups but will also give impetus to the self reliant india campaign friends our country is a rich treasure house of many languages scripts and dialects varied attire cuisine and culture in different regions is our hallmark as a nation this diversity strengthens us and keeps us united i wish to share with all of you a very inspiring example related to this which is that of beti kalpana her name is kalpana but her endeavor is full of the true spirit of ek bharat shreshtha bharat actually kalpana has recently passed her class 10th examination in karnataka but the very special thing about her success is that kalpana did not know kannada language till some time ago she not only learned kannada language in three months but also proved it by scoring 92 marks you might be surprised to know this but it is true there are many other things about her that will amaze you and will also inspire you kalpana is originally from joshimath in uttarakhand she had been suffering from tb earlier and when she was in the class three she lost her eyesight too but as they say where there is a will there is a way kalpana later came in contact with professor taramurthy a resident of mysuru who not only encouraged her but also helped her in every way today through her hard work she has set an example for all of us i congratulate kalpana for her fortitude similarly there are many people in our country who are working towards strengthening the linguistic diversity of the country one such friend shripati tudu ji hails from purulia in west bengal tudu ji is a professor of santhali language at sidho kaano birsa university purulia he has prepared a version of the country s constitution in his native ol chiki script for the santhali community shripati tudu ji asserts that our constitution makes every citizen of our country aware of one s rights and duties therefore it is important for every citizen to be familiar with it therefore he prepared a copy of the constitution in his own script for the santhali community and offered it as a gift i appreciate this thinking of shripati ji and his efforts this is a living example of the spirit of ek bharat shrestha bharat you will also find information about many such efforts furthering this spirit on the website of ek bharat shreshtha bharat here you will get to know about activities on many such subjects including food art culture tourism you can also take part in these activities this will give you information about your country and you will also experience the diversity of the country my dear countrymen the holy pilgrimage of char dham in uttarakhand is currently underway in our country thousands of devotees are reaching every day at char dham and especially in kedarnath people are sharing happy experiences of their char dham yatra but i have also seen that some devotees are also very sad because of the filth being spread by some pilgrims in kedarnath many people have expressed their views on social media as well going on a holy pilgrimage and coming across a heap of filth there is not right but friends in the midst of these complaints one is getting to see many good pictures too where there is faith there is also creation and positivity there are many devotees who are worshiping in the dham of baba kedar as well as performing the sadhna of cleanliness some are cleaning near the place of stay while others are cleaning garbage along the travel route many organizations and voluntary organizations are also working there along with the swachh bharat campaign team friends just as a pilgrimage is important here equally important is teertha sewa as has been mentioned and i would also say that without teertha sewa a pilgrimage is also incomplete there are many people in devbhoomi uttarakhand who are engaged in the sadhana of cleanliness and service you will be greatly inspired by shriman manoj bainjwal hailing form rudra prayag for the last 25 years manoj ji has taken it upon himself to look after the environment apart from running the campaign of cleanliness he is also engaged in making holy places plastic free while surendra bagwadi ji hailing from guptkashi has also made cleanliness his life mantra in guptkashi he regularly runs cleanliness programmes and i have learned that he has also named this campaign as mann ki baat similarly champa devi from village devar has been teaching waste management to women of the village champa ji has planted hundreds of trees and through sheer hard work she has set up a stretch of forest full of greenery friends through the efforts of such people the divinity of dev bhoomi and holy places has been maintained we go there to experience it so it is our responsibility to maintain this divinity and spirituality along with chardham yatra in our country there will be many yatras like amarnath yatra pandharpur yatra and jagannath yatra in the coming times in the month of sawan some fair or the other is held perhaps in every village friends wherever we go let us maintain the dignity of these pilgrimage sites purity cleanliness and a pious environment we should never forget these and for that it is imperative that we abide by the resolution of cleanliness a few days later the world will celebrate the 5th of june as environment day we should run positive environment campaigns around us and this is a never ending task this time you should join everyone together you should certainly make some effort for cleanliness and tree plantation plant a tree yourself and inspire others too my dear countrymen next month on the 21st of june we are going to celebrate the 8th international yoga day this time the theme of yoga day is yoga for humanity i would urge all of you to celebrate yoga day with great enthusiasm yes also take precautions related to corona by the way the situation now is looking better than earlier across the

to celebrate yoga day choose any place in your city town or village which is most special this place can be an ancient temple and tourist center or it could be the banks of a famous river lake or pond with this along with yoga the identity of your area will also be reinforced and tourism there will also get a boost at present the 100 day countdown leading to yoga day is also underway rather programs based on personal and social efforts have already begun three months ago on these lines there have been countdown programs of 100th day and 75th day in delhi similarly 50th countdown events

programmes i got a chance to meet some wonderful personalities i want to discuss about them with you in mann ki baat though they belong to japan they harbour amazing attachment and love for india one of them is hiroshi koike ji who is a well known art director you will be very happy to know that he has directed the mahabharat project this project was started in cambodia and it is continuing for the last 9 years hiroshi koike ji performs every task in a very different way every year he travels to one country in asia and produces parts of the mahabharata with local artists and musicians there through this project he has done productions and given stage performances in nine countries including india cambodia and indonesia hiroshi koike ji brings together artists who have had a diverse background in classical and traditional asian performing art because of that different hues are seen in his work performers from indonesia thailand malaysia and japan make it more attractive through java dance balinese dance thai dance the special thing is that in this each performer speaks in his own mother tongue and the choreography very beautifully displays this diversity and the diversity of music makes this production more lively their aim is to bring to the fore the importance of diversity and co existence in our society and what peace should really be like besides them the other two people i met in japan are atsushi matsuo ji and kenji yoshi ji both of them are associated with tem production company this company is associated with the japanese animation film based on ramayana that was released in 1993 this project was associated with japan s very famous film director yugo sako ji about 40 years ago in 1983 he came to know about ramayana for the first time ramayana touched his heart after which he started researching deeply on it not only that he read 10 versions of ramayana in japanese language and not only did he stop at this he also wanted to showcase it through animation in this indian animators also helped him a lot he was guided about the indian customs and traditions shown in the film he was told how people in india wear the dhoti how they wear the saree

Modi encouraged citizens to provide suggestions on the ""Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat"" (One India, Best India) initiative and emphasized the importance of physical fitness and exercise, especially during the winter season.",29-nov-2015 my dear countrymen namaste i believe you must have had a great time during your diwali vacations amidst all festivities you must have had the opportunity to visit some other places the new trades and jobs would have commenced with renewed vigour on the other hand christmas preparations must have started too festivals have their own significance in social life sometimes festivities help to heal wounds and sometimes they are source of renewed energy but sometimes when a calamity strikes during festivities then it is very painful and it feels even more there is continuous news of natural calamities from various parts of the world and sometimes the news is very bizarre never seen or never heard of we are now realizing the effects of climate change very rapidly in our country itself we have experienced torrential rains that too without season and for a very long duration tamil nadu has suffered heavy losses and other states suffered too many people lost their lives my heart goes out to all those people in this hour of crisis the state governments have braced themselves up for rescue and relief work the central government too has joined them in their efforts right now a team of the central government officials are in tamil nadu but i have full faith in tamil nadu s potential and know that post this crisis it will rise again and speedily move forward and will continue to deliver in its role of taking the country forward now when there are talks of such crisis all around we feel the need to bring in a lot of change about 15 years back natural calamity was a part of the agricultural ministry s realm because most of the calamities were limited to famine but today its form and format has changed it has become important to work on our capacity building at every level the government civil society the citizens and the small organizations will all have to work for capacity building through scientific temperament after the nepal earthquake i talked to pakistan s prime minister nawaz sharif i suggested that the saarc nations should come together for a joint exercise on disaster preparedness i am happy that a seminar workshop on table talk exercises and best practices was organized in delhi this is a good beginning today i received a phone call from lakhwinder singh from jalandhar punjab i am lakhwinder singh from jalandhar punjab we do organic farming in our fields and also guide a lot of others regarding it i have a question how to guide people that burning of farm remains or straw not only destroys the micro organisms of the soil but also contributes to the pollution in delhi punjab and haryana lakhwinder singh ji i am happy to hear your message i am happy that you are a farmer engaged in organic farming and not just that you also understand the problems of the farmers really well your concerns are right but this just does not happen in punjab and haryana alone it is a practice in the entire country and traditionally we follow this method of burning off the remains of the crops or the straw initially we were not aware of the damage we did it because the others did it secondly people are not aware of the available solutions they have not been trained about it and this practice kept on spreading and now it is contributing to global climate change and now we are hearing more about it because it is affecting the city life too but the concern you have expressed is genuine so the first solution is that the brothers and sisters engaged in agriculture need to be trained they will need to face the truth on their thinking that burning the remains of crops helps save time and effort and prepares the field for the next crop but this is not the truth the remains of the crop are themselves very valuable they are organic fertilizer themselves we are wasting them not only this if they are chopped into small bits they can act as a dry fruit for cattle secondly because of burning this the top soil gets burnt my dear farmer brothers and sisters just think that if we have strong bones strong heart strong kidney an overall good system but our upper skin gets burnt then what will happen even if the heart is strong we will not be able to survive so burning the stump of crops not only burns them it burns the skin of our motherland the top soil of our land is burnt which pushes our fertile soil to death hence some positive efforts need to be made if these remains are once again buried inside the soil then it will turn into fertilizers if they are put in a pit and left with earth worms and little water good quality organic fertilizer can be made so it can be used not only to feed the animals and save our land but also to create good fertilizer if this is added to the soil it will be doubly beneficial once i had the opportunity of talking to farmers involved in banana cultivation and they shared a very good experience earlier as they cultivated banana when the crop was over the stumps of the tree would remain to clear the stumps from the fields they had to spend 5 000 10 000 or 15 000 rupees per hectare and till the time the people who would clear these stumps would not come with tractors the stumps would remain standing for long but some farmers chopped those stumps into 6 6 8 8 inch pieces and buried them inside the soil they experienced that the banana stumps held so much water in them that no external water supply was needed for three months any plant or any crop sown over those stumps could flourish without water the water in the stumps kept the crops alive and now even their stumps are expensive they are now a source of income earlier they had to spend money on clearing those stumps now those very stumps are a source of revenue a small experiment can turn lucrative our farmers are no less than scientists dear countrymen the entire world will remember 3rd december as international day of persons with disabilities last time in mann ki baat i talked about organ donation i talked about the noto helpline for organ donation i have been told that after that session the number of phone calls increased 7 times and the number of hits on the website increased 2 5 times 27th november was celebrated as indian organ donation day many famous personalities including actress raveena tandon became a part of it organ donation can save many valuable lives organ donation can bring about immortality when an organ moves from one body to another it gets a new life but the person receiving it gets a new lease of life there can be no greater donation than this i would like to inform those waiting for organs and those willing to donate that a national registry for organ transplantation has been launched on 27th november mygov in organized a logo donor card and slogan design competition for noto and it was surprising to me that so many people participated and presented their ideas in such innovative ways with such compassion it is my faith that awareness in this field will increase and the needful will receive the best of help in true sense this help cannot be obtained till someone donates their organs like i said earlier 3rd december is being celebrated as international day of people with disability people with physical and mental disabilities are capable of unparalleled courage and capability sometimes it hurts when they are laughed at sometimes someone expresses pity and sympathy but if we change our outlook and our perspective towards them then these people can inspire us to live they can inspire us to do a lot we start crying even when small misfortune befalls us then we realize our problem is so small but how does he survive how does he live how does he learn and hence all of them are a source of inspiration to us their will power their struggle with life and their zeal to transform crisis into opportunity is worth lot of praise today i want to talk about javed ahmed he is 40 42 years old in 1996 the terrorists had shot jawed ahmed in kashmir he was a victim of the terrorists but he survived but the bullet damaged his kidney and a part of the intestine was lost he suffered serious spinal injury he lost the ability to stand on his own feet but jawed ahmed did not concede defeat the grave injury caused by terrorism could not deter him his zeal is commendable but above all is the fact that an innocent man had to face such a predicament his youth is in danger yet he harbors no grudge and no anger he turned this crisis into compassion and dedicated his life to social work the body does not support him but for the past 20 years he has devoted himself to child education how to improve the infrastructure for the physically challenged how to develop systems for the disabled in government offices and public spaces he is working on those issues he turned the focus of his educational qualification in those areas he took a masters degree in social work and is now leading a silent revolution as a messiah of the disabled working as an informed citizen is his life not enough to inspire us in every corner of india i especially remember the life of jawed ahmed his dedication and devotion especially on every 3rd december i am mentioning just the case of jawed because of lack of time but such lights of inspiration are prevalent in every corner of the country they are giving a new lease of life and illuminating the path for others 3rd december is a day to remember all such people and get inspired by them our country is very large there are many things for which we are dependent on the government be it someone from middle class lower middle class dalit exploited victim or deprived they have to continuously be in touch with the government or its various organizations and as a citizen we surely have a bad experience with a government official in our lifetime and that one experience shapes our perception of the government system for a lifetime there is some truth to it but at the same time within this governmental system there are lakhs of people who by their sense of duty their dedication do some amazing work which does not get recognized sometimes it happens so naturally it is so organic that one does not realize some government employee has done it in our country there is a network of asha workers we have never discussed them in our country and i too have neither heard about them nor would you have the success of the works of the entrepreneur couple bill and melinda gates through their foundation has become an inspiration last year we honoured them with a joint padma vibhushan they do a lot of social work in india they are spending their entire retirement time and whatever they have earned on working for the poor they are so full of praise for the asha workers they work with they talk about their dedication and hard work and their zeal to learn about new things they are full of such stories in the past the orissa government especially facilitated an asha worker on independence day she hails from a small village tenda gaon in balasore district where most of the population is scheduled tribe there the people are poor and the area is malaria infested the asha worker jamuna manisingh decided that she will not let anyone die of malaria she would go to each household and would be the first one to reach if there was news of fever in any household she would put to use the primary training she received and give treatment accordingly she would reach out to every household to use mosquito repellent and mosquito nets the way we care for our kids and their sound sleep jamuna manisingh would work with the same dedication for the entire village she fought with malaria and prepared the entire village to fight against it there might be so many jamuna mani there might be lakhs and lakhs of people around us let us show respect to such individuals such individuals lend power to our nation they are partners to the joys and sorrows of others i applaud all such asha workers through the story of jamuna mani my dear young friends who are especially active on the internet and the social media i want to inform that i have kept 3 e books on mygov in these e books are about inspiring stories of swatch bharat health sector and the sansad aadarsh gram yojana i request you to see it just don t see it show it to others too read it and may be you may find something to connect with it please do send it to mygov in such things do happen though we may miss them but they are the actual strength of our nation positive power is the biggest energy you also share good episodes share these e books discuss these books and some enthusiastic young man can narrate these to the students of viii ix or x standard in the nearby schools so you can become a social teacher in

nook and corner and now it has become an accepted standard for embarking on any new task the earth s temperature should not rise anymore this is everyone s concern and responsibility too and to save us from rising temperatures the first step is energy conservation 14th december is national energy conservation day the government is running many schemes there is a scheme of increasing l e d bulb usage i had once mentioned to switch off the street lights on a full moon night and enjoy the moonlight for an hour one should enjoy the moonlight some friend of mine had sent me a link and i had the opportunity to see it i really wanted to share it with you the actual credit goes to zee news because the link was of zee news there is a woman noor jahan in kanpur watching her on television it seemed that she did not have much of a chance to get education but she is doing something which no one would have thought of she is utilizing the solar energy of the sun to illuminate the houses of the poor she is fighting darkness and bringing light to her own name she has formed a samiti committee of women who manufacture lanterns that run on solar energy they rent the lantern for rs 100 per month people take the lanterns in the evening and return them in the mornings for recharging i have heard that people in large numbers around 500 people are using these lanterns in an expense of rs 3 4 per day the entire house is illuminated noor jehan works the entire day to recharge the lanterns in the solar energy plant see what the big people of the world do for climate change maybe noor jehan

29-Nov-20,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on November 29, 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared several noteworthy developments and thoughts. He began by announcing the return of a stolen idol of Devi Annapurna from Canada, symbolizing the recovery of India's heritage. He also highlighted the significance of World Heritage Week in preserving cultural heritage and the digitization efforts taking place in museums and libraries.

universities across the country and be a part of important events in their journey of education through technology i was able to connect with students of iit guwahati iit delhi deendayal petroleum university of gandhinagar jnu of delhi mysore university and lucknow university to be amongst the youth of the country is extremely refreshing and energizing university campuses in a way are like mini india in these campuses on the one hand we see the diversity of india on the other we also find great passion for changes for a new india before corona when i used to go for a face to face event at any institution i would urge that poor students from nearby schools to be invited to the function those children have been attending the functions as my special guests when a small child in the grand function watches a young person becoming a doctor engineer scientist sees someone receiving a medal new dreams awaken in the child i too can do it this self confidence arises there is inspiration for resolve friends besides this i am always interested in knowing who the alumni of the institution are what the arrangements by the institution for regular engagement with its alumni are how vibrant their alumni network is my young friends you are a student of an institution only till you study there but you remain an alumni of that institution lifelong after leaving school or college two things never end one the influence of your education and second your bonding with your school or college whenever alumni interact with each other in their memories of school or college greater time is given to reminiscing about time on campus and moments spent with friends than about books and studies and from these memories a feeling is bornto do something for the institution what can bring greater happiness than to lend a hand in development of the place where your personality was moulded i have read certain such efforts where the former students have given back to their old institutions in great measure nowadays alumni are very active in this iitians have provided their institutions many facilities like conference centres management centres incubation centres set up by their efforts all of these endeavors improve the learning experience of the current students iit delhi has initiated an endowment fund which is a brilliant idea there is a culture of such endowments inrenowned universities across the world which helps the students i think that universities of india are also capable to institutionalize this culture when it comes to returning something nothing can be deemed big or small even the smallest help matters every effort is important often alumni play a very important role in technology upgradation of their institutions in construction of buildings in initiating awards and scholarships and in starting programs for skill development the old student associations of certain schools have started mentorship programmes in these programmes they guide the students of different batches and also discuss educational prospects alumni associations are robust in many schools especially in boarding schools where they organize activities like sports tournaments and community service i would like to urge former students to keep consolidating their bonding with the institution in which they have studied whether it is at the level of school college or university i also urge the institutions to work on new and innovative ways of alumni engagement and develop creative platforms so that alumni can be actively involved a strong vibrant active alumni network is needed not only in big colleges and universities but also in schools of our villages my dear countrymen the 5thdecember is the death anniversary of sri aurobindo the more we read sri aurobindo greater is the insight that we get the more my young friends learn about sriaurobindo greater will they learn about themselves enriching themselves the state of inner consciousness in which you are where you are engaged in trying to achieve the many resolves amid all this you will always find a new inspiration in sri aurobindo you will find him showing you a new path just as at present when we are moving forward with the campaign vocal for local sri aurobindo s philosophy of swadeshi shows us the path there is a very profound poemin bangla sui chhutopoy monto ashe tunga hote diya shalaikathi tau aasepote pro deeptijalitekhete shutee jethe kichhuteloknoyashadhiaan that is here even the sewing needle and match stick come on a foreign ship the people are not free even in eating drinking sleeping he also used to say that swadeshi means that we give priority to the things made by our indian workers and artisans it is not that sri aurobindo ever opposed learning anything from abroad wherever there is anything new we should learn from there and then support and encourage what can be good for our country and that is the spirit of the vocal for local mantra in the atmanirbhar bharat campaign especially what shri aurobindo opined about adopting swadeshi should be read by every citizen today friends likewise shri aurobindo s views on education were very lucid he did not consider education to be limited only to bookish knowledge degree and job sri aurobindo used to say that our national education should focus on training of the hearts and minds of our younger generation that is scientific development of the mind and indian ethos residein the heart should also be there then only a young person can become a better citizen of the country whatever shri aurobindosaid about national education and expected then the country is now achieving it through the new national education policy my dear countrymen new dimensions are being added to agriculture and its related activities in india the agricultural reforms in the past few days have also now opened new doors of possibilities for our farmers the demands that have been made by farmers for years that every political party at some point or the other made the promise to fulfill those demands have been met after a lot of deliberation the parliament of india gave a legal formto the agricultural reforms these reforms have not only served to unshackle our farmers but also given them new rights and opportunities in just a short span of time these new rights have begun to ameliorate the woes of our farmers you too should know how jitendra bhoiji a farmer from dhule district in maharashtra made use of the recently promulgated farm laws jitendra bhoiji had sown corn and decided to sell his produce to traders for a right price the total cost of the produce was fixed at approximately rupees three lakh thirty two thousand jitendra bhoi even received an advance of rupees twenty five thousand it had been decided that the outstanding amount would be cleared in fifteen days however later such circumstances developed that he did not receive the remainder of his payment buy the crop from the farmer keep the payment pending for months on end probably this was the long standing tradition that the buyers of corn were following this continued for four months wherein jitendra ji was not paid his dues in this situation the new farm laws that were passed in september came to his aid under this law it was decided that all dues of the farmers should be cleared within three days of procurement failing which the farmer can lodge a complaint another notable aspect of this law is that the area sub divisional magistrate sdm has to ensure grievance redressal of the farmer within one month now with our farmer brother empowered with this law his grievance had to be redressed consequently he lodged a complaint and within days his outstanding payments were cleared this correct and complete knowledge of the law became the strength of jitendra ji whichever the field correct knowledge free from misconceptions and rumors can act as a force multiplier for every individual mohammad aslam ji from baran district in rajasthan is working in a similar fashion to increase awareness among farmers he is also the ceo of a farmer producer organization yes you heard it right the ceo of a farmer producer organization i hope this is heartwarming news for the ceos of major companies that farmers from far flung areas of the country are now also becoming ceos of farmer organizations friends mohammad aslam ji has made a whatsapp group comprising several farmers from his area on this group everyday he shares updates with the farmers on prevalent prices at neighboring mandis in the area his own fpo also buys produce from farmers hence this effort of his also helps farmers in taking a decision friends awareness beget spiritedness shri virendra yadav ji is one such farmer entrepreneur who has influenced the lives of thousands through his awareness sometime ago virendra yadav ji used to live in australia two years ago he came to india and now lives in kaithal haryana just like others the stubble in the fields was a big concern for him too work is being done on a massive scale to find the solution to this issue however today in mann ki baat i am especially mentioning virendra ji because his efforts are different and show a new way forward to find a solution to stubble virendra ji bought a straw baler machine to make bundles of straw for this he also received financial assistance from the agricultural department with this machine he began to make bundles of stubble after having made the bundles he sold the stubble to agro energy plants and paper mills you will be amazed to know that in just two years virendra ji has traded in stubble in excess of rupees two and a half crores and has earned a profit of approximately rupees fifty lakhs the benefit of thisalso accrues to the farmers of those fields from where virendra ji sources his stubble we have often heard of waste to wealth however this initiative is a unique example of earning money and righteous goodwill while finding a solution to the problem of stubble to the youth especially the lakhs of students who are studying agriculture it is my request that they visit villages in their vicinity and talk to the farmers and make them aware about innovations in farming and the recent agricultural reforms this way you will become stakeholders in major reforms underway in the country my dear countrymen in mann ki baat we refer to a wide range of issues and topics however it has been one year of one such incidentwe would never want to remember fondly it has been roughly one year since the world came to know of the first case of corona since then the entire world has seen several ups and downs coming out of the lockdown now the discussion on a vaccine has commenced however any sort of negligence regarding corona can be deadly even now we have to firmly keep fighting against corona friends baba saheb ambedkar s punya tithi death anniversary is in a few days from now on the 6th of december besides paying our homage to baba saheb this day is also an occasion to reaffirm our resolve to the country and abiding by the duties assigned to us by the constitution as an individual a

adhered to the unique festival chhath pooja is deeply linked with nature worshiping nature surya jal the sun water are central to the veneration in chhath whereas utensils made of bamboo clay and tubers are an essential part of the pooja articles in this mega festival of faith veneration of the rising sun and worship of the setting sun convey a message that is replete with unparalleled sanskar the world respects venerates those who rise the chatth pooja bestows upon us the sanskaar to respect revere those whose setting whose dusk is imminent the expression of the significance of cleanliness in our lives is intrinsic to this festival before the advent of chatth people come together to clean up their homes and along with that cleansing of rivers lakes pond banks and pooja locations that is ghats with utmost enthusiasm fervour sun worship or chhath pooja is a festival of protecting the environment ushering in wellness and discipline usually people shy away from borrowing from others but in chhath pooja it is specially customary to ask for prasad after the morning arghya ritual it is believed that the rationale behind this tradition is that it destroys his ego that proves to be an impediment in one s path of progress it is natural for each one of us to feel proud of this great tradition of india my dear countrymen mann ki baat has garnered accolades it has also attracted criticism but whenever i look at the overall outcome of mann ki baat it reinforces my belief that it is intrinsically inseparably woven into the warp weft of our common citizens lives cent per cent take the examples of khadi and handloom on gandhi jayanti i have always advocated the use of handloom and khadi what has it led to you will be glad to know that on the 17th of this month on the day of dhanteras the khadi gramodyog bhavan store in delhi witnessed a record sale of rupees one crore twenty lakhs you too must be feeling happy with a sense of satisfaction at this mega sale in just one khadi handloom store during diwali khadi gift coupon sales recorded an overwhelming 680 per cent rise compared to last year the total sales of khadi handicrafts have risen almost by 90 one can clearly see that today the youth the elderly women in fact every age group is taking to khadi handloom i can imagine how many weaver families poor families and the families working on handlooms must have benefitted from this khadi was khadi foundation earlier and we talked of khadi fashion but with my recent experience i can say that after khadi for nation and khadi for fashion now it is becoming khadi for transformation khadi and handloom have transformed the lives of the poorest of the poor and are emerging as a powerful means of empowering them it is playing a very important role for gramodaya shriman rajan bhatt has written on narendramodiapp that he wants to know about my experience of celebrating diwali with security forces and he also wants to know how the security forces celebrate diwali shriman tejas gaikwad has also written on narendramodiapp whether there could be an arrangement to send our homemade sweets to the security forces we also remember our brave security

got another chance to celebrate deepawali with our courageous and brave heart security personnel memories of diwali celebrations with our security forces in gurez sector of jammu kashmir will stay long cherished in my heart on behalf of all our countrymen i salute every soldier of our security forces who guard the country s borders with utmost dedication and a spirit of sacrifice braving all odds whenever we get a chance or whenever there is an opportunity we must try to know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their tales of valour many of us may not be aware that the jawans of our security forces play an important role not only on our borders but they play a very vital role in establishing peace the world over as un peacekeepers they are bringing glory to the nation in the comity of nations united nations day was observed recently all over the world on the 24th of october everybody recalls the efforts and constructive role of the un in establishing peace throughout the world and we are believers in vasudhaiv kutumbakam which means the whole world is our family and with this belief india has been cooperating very actively in various important initiatives taken by the un you may be aware that the preface of the indian constitution and the preface of the un charter both start with the words we the people india has always stressed on the importance of equality for women and the un declaration of human rights is a living example of this in its initial phrase it was proposed as all men are born free and equal which was amended and adopted as all human beings are born free and equal with the efforts of the indian representative hansa mehta it appears to be a minor change but it reflects a vision of a healthy thought india s most important contribution under the un umbrella is its role in un peacekeeping operations india has always been extending active support to un peace missions many of you may be getting to know this for the first time more than 18 thousand indian security personnel have lent their services in un peacekeeping operations presently about seven thousand indian soldiers are associated with un peacekeeping initiatives which is the third highest number of soldiers from any country till august 2017 indian soldiers had lent their services in about 50 of the total of 71 peacekeeping operations undertaken by the un the world over these operations have been carried out in korea cambodia laos vietnam congo cyprus liberia lebanon sudan and many other parts of the world in congo and southern sudan more than twenty thousand patients were treated in hospitals of the indian army and countless lives were saved indian security forces have not only saved people in various countries but also won their hearts with their people friendly operations indian women have played a leading role in peace keeping efforts very few people may know that india was the first country which sent a female police unit to liberia for the united nations peace mission and see how this initiative from india became a big source of motivation for other countries too later all countries started sending their women police units you will surely feel proud to know that india s contribution is not limited to just peacekeeping operations but it is also providing training to peacekeepers from about eighty five countries the brave peacekeepers from this land of mahatma gandhi and gautam budha have sent a message of peace and amity around the world peacekeeping operation is not an easy task jawans from our security forces have to perform duties in difficult and remote areas they have to live amongst many different people they need to know and adapt to various situations and different cultures they have to mould themselves according to the local needs and environment while remembering our brave un peacekeepers today who can forget the sacrifice of captain gurbachan singh salaria who laid down his life while fighting in congo in africa every indian feels proud while remembering him he was the only un peacekeeper a brave heart who was awarded the param veer chakra lieutenant general prem chand ji is one among those indian peacekeepers who carved a special niche for themselves in cyprus in 1989 at the age of 72 he was appointed the force commander for an operation in namibia and he gave his services to ensure the independence of that country general thimaiyya who had been india s army chief lead the un peacekeeping force in cyprus and sacrificed everything for those peace efforts india has always been giving a message of peace unity and harmony to the world we believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move ahead to carve a better and peaceful tomorrow my dear countrymen our holy land has given great souls who selflessly served humanity sister nivedita whom we also know as bhagini nivedita was one such extraordinary person she was born in ireland as margret elizabeth noble but swami vivekanand gave her the name nivedita and nivedita means the one who is fully dedicated she later proved herself true to her name yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of sister nivedita she was so impressed by swami vivekanand that she renounced her happy prosperous life and dedicated herself to the service of the poor sister nivedita felt very hurt by the atrocities of the british rule the britishers not only made us slaves but they tried to enslave us mentally as well constant efforts to belittle our culture and make us feel inferior were on bhagini nivedita ji revived the dignity and pride of indian culture she brought the people together by infusing a sense of national awakening she travelled to various countries and raised her voice against the mischievous propaganda against sanatan dharma and ideology renowned nationalist and tamil poet subramanya bharati is well known for his revolutionary poem pudhumai penn or new woman and is renowned for his efforts for women empowerment it is said that bhagini nivedita was the inspiration bhagini nivedita ji also helped the great scientist jagdish chandra basu she helped publication of basu s research and publicity through her articles and conferences this is india s unique beauty that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture sister nivedita and scientist jagdish chandra basu are a powerful testimony to this in 1899 plague broke out in calcutta and hundreds of people lost their lives in no time sister nivedita without caring for her health started cleaning drains and roads she was a woman who could live a luxurious life but she dedicatedly worked for the poor getting inspiration from her sacrifice people came forward and joined her through her work she spread the message of the importance of cleanliness and service to mankind and it is inscribed on her grave here reposes sister nivedita who gave her all to india undoubtedly she did so there cannot be any other befitting tribute to this great soul than every indian taking a lesson from her life and emulating her thank you for your phone call first of all many felicitations to all the children on the occasion of children s day celebrated on the birthday of our first prime minister jawaharlal nehru ji children are the emerging heroes in the creation of new india your concern is correct that the diseases which surfaced in old age or emerged around the last lap of life have started to appear in children nowadays it is indeed surprising today when we hear that children are suffering from diabetes in earlier times such diseases were known as raj rog which means diseases that used to afflict only the rich or those who lived a life of luxury such diseases were very rare in young people but our lifestyle has changed today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders one of the main reasons for being afflicted with such diseases at a young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in our eating habits society and the family need to pay attention towards this crisis if you ll start paying attention to it you will see that there is no need to do anything extraordinary you just need to make small regular changes in order to transform your habits making them a part of your way of life i would like the family to consciously try to inculcate in children the habit of playing in open grounds if possible we can make the elder family members accompany these children to the playground and play with them the children can be made to take the stairs instead of taking the lift after dinner the entire family can go for a walk with the children yoga for young india yoga will be helpful for especially our young friends in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorders the practice of yoga 30 minutes before school can impart much benefit it can also be practised at home and the specialty of yoga is that it is easy simple and accessible to all i am saying this because a person of any age can easily practise it it is simple because it can be easily learned and it is accessible since it can be done anywhere no special tools or fields are needed there are several studies being conducted on how yoga is effective in curbing diabetes these studies are being carried out in aiims too and the results that have emerged so far are very encouraging do not look at ayurveda and yoga as a means of medical treatment only instead of this we should make them a part of our life my dear countrymen especially my young friends we have been getting glad tidings from the field of sports in different games our athletes have made the country proud in hockey india has won the asia cup hockey title through its dazzling performance our players

if i have to do justice to their feelings then i will have to do the program mann ki baat every day and every day mann ki baat will be dedicated solely to the subject of cleanliness some listeners send photo graphs of the efforts undertaken by children whereas others mention the role of youth in these efforts sometimes there is a story of an innovation to bring about cleanliness or winds of change that get ushered due to an official s zeal a few days ago i received a very detailed report highlighting the story of transformation of chandrapur fort in maharashtra an ngo called ecological protection organization launched a cleanliness campaign in chandrapur fort in this campaign lasting for two hundred days people performed the task of cleaning the fort non stop without any fatigue and with team work just think two hundred days of continuous labour they sent me photographs with a caption before and after i was overwhelmed on seeing these and whoever will see these photographs no

in today s episode of mann ki baat i shall also talk about a great personality of the country cherished by all indians with respect and affection from the core of their hearts there must be hardly an indian citizen who does not show deep regard for her does not revere her she is elder to most of us and has been a witness to myriad phases different eras the country has passed through we address her as didi elder sister lata didi she turns ninety this 28th of september before leaving on the foreign tour i was blessed with an opportunity to converse with her on the phone this chat was akin to a younger brother speaking to his elder sister affectionately i usually refrain from sharing such personal conversations but today i want you to listen to the tete a tete listen to lata didi listen to it for yourself how lata didi is earnestly concerned and eager about everything concerning the country her satisfaction and reassurance too lies in the progress being made by india the india on the path of change the india that is gaining newer heights my dear countrymen with the advent of navaratri today the air is bound to be full of new hopes new energy newer zest and newer resolves once again after all it s the festival season the ensuing weeks shall be witness to the sparkle of festivals throughout the country all of us shall celebrate the navaratri mahotsava garba durga puja dussehra diwali bhaiya dooj chhath puja in fact innumerable festivals heartiest greetings to all of you for these festivals to come during festivals families come together homes will be filled with joy but you must have felt this there are many people around us who remain deprived of these celebrations and this is what is termed as chirag tale andhera darkness just beneath the lamp perhaps this adage is not just a set of words for us it is an order a philosophical thought or an inspiration just think about it there are some homes bathed in shimmering lights on the other hand just close by there are some homes mired in darkness there are homes where sweetmeats are left to rot there are homes where children yearn for a sweet at places almirahs run out of space to store more clothes elsewhere people have to slog to earn a decent covering for their bodies so is this not the darkness just beneath the lamp indeed it is the true joy radiating out of festivals is only when the darkness subsides and dissipates and a radiant glow emerges let us distribute joy where there is a paucity of it let it come naturally to us on the one hand when we experience the delivery in of sweetmeats apparel gifts and so on let us think for a moment on the process of delivery out at least in our homes items that are in excess and thus not required anymore could be allocated for delivery out in many cities many ngos run by young friends have formed startups for this endeavor they collect clothes sweets food from homes look for the needy and hand them over discreetly can we this time during the festival season dispel some of the darkness beneath the lamp with due awareness and resolve the smiles thus accrued on the faces of numerous underprivileged families will more than double your joy during festivals your faces will be lit up with a glow that will brighten your diwali immensely my dear brothers and sisters laxmi the goddess of wealth makes an entry into each and every household in the form of fortune and prosperity of course laxmi should be welcomed in the traditional way can we this time introduce a novelty in welcoming her in our culture daughters are considered laxmi since they are harbinger of fortune and prosperity can we this time around in society organize programmes to felicitate daughters in villages towns and cities it could be in the form of a public function there must be numerous daughters amongst us who through there perseverance diligence and talent have brought glory to their families society and the country this diwali can we arrange programmes to honor the laxmi of india if you look around you ll find many daughters and daughters in law who are performing extraordinarily some must be engaged in teaching underprivileged children others could be occupied in spreading awareness in the field of sanitation and health while many could be doing society a service by working as doctor and engineers or striving for justice to someone by working as lawyer our society must recognize such daughters honor them and feel proud of them programmes to felicitate them should be held throughout the country we could do something more we could highlight the achievements of these daughters by sharing their achievements on social media using the hashtag bharat ki laxmi the way we jointly ran a mega campaign selfie with daughter which spread globally similarly this time let us do a campaign bharat ki laxmi encouraging the laxmi of bharat amounts to strengthening the paths of prosperity for the country and her citizens my dear countrymen as i have mentioned earlier a great advantage of mann ki baat is that i m blessed with the opportunity to converse with a lot of people known or unknown directly or indirectly a few days ago aleena taayang a student from far off arunachal has written an interesting letter to me and the contents are let me read out the letter to you respected mr prime minister my name is aleena taayang i hail from roing arunachal pradesh on my exam result this time some people asked me if i had read the book exam warriors i replied in the negative but on returning i purchased the book and read it more than twice my experience after that has been very good i felt had i read the book before my exams i would have benefited a great deal i liked quite a few aspects of this book but i noticed that it contains may mantras for students but for parents and teachers this book does not have much i wish if you are thinking anew on a new edition do include a few mantras for parents and teachers and of course new content see even my young friends bear this trust that whatever they ask the pradhan sevak the principal servant of the country to do it will be done my young student friends first of all i thank you for writing to me thank you for reading exam warriors more than twice and special thanks for pointing out shortcomings in the book at the same time my little friend has entrusted me with a task in fact there are orders for me i shall certainly comply with your directions as you have told me i shall positively try to write something for parents as well as teachers as and when i get the time to pen a new edition but i urge all of you can you be of help to me it is about experiences in your daily lives i call upon all students teachers and parents to come up with your experiences and suggestions on aspects of stress free exams i shall duly go through them study them i ll give it due thought and whatever comes across as apt i shall try and incorporate that in my own words and quite possibly if the suggestions are sufficiently large in number it will lend certitude to the idea of a new edition so i shall eagerly wait for your thoughts to flow once again i express my gratitude to our little friend student aleena taayang from arunachal my dear countrymen you update yourselves with the busy schedule of the prime minister of the country through newspapers and television you even discuss the engagements but i hope you are aware that i am just as common a being as you are being an ordinary citizen whatever affects you has the same effect on me since i m just one amongst you just see how on the one hand victory in the u s open was discussed on the other runner up daniil medvedev s speech was equally doing the rounds in public discourse especially on social media hence i too heard the speech and watched the match the sheer simplicity and maturity displayed by the 23 year old daniil medvedev touched everyone it surely stirred me moments before this speech he had suffered defeat at the hands of tennis legend rafael nadal 19 times grand slam winner an event such as this would have pushed anyone towards remorse and despair in the case of medvedev there was no sign of the slightest pallor on his countenance rather his expression lit up the faces of those watching him with meaningful smiles he won hearts with his humility and simplicity the epitome of the spirit of sportsmanship in the truest sense that he is in letter and spirit spectators welcomed his reflections with warmth and fervor he also touched upon nadal being the inspiring force in tennis for millions of young people adding how difficult it was to face him in the game the way medvedev heaped praise on his opponent after a defeat in a fierce duel makes him a living example of the true essence of the spirit of sportsmanship of course on the other hand champion nadal too showered glowing praise on daniil s game the display of the indomitable ardour of the defeated and the sheer humility of the victorious in the same frame was a sight to behold if you haven t heard medvedev s speech yet i shall urge you especially young friends to watch this video it holds much for people across the age and class spectra to see and learn these are moments that go way beyond winning and losing where victory and defeat cease to be it is life that is victory this has been beautifully articulated in our scriptures the wisdom of our ancestors is truly praiseworthy our ancient texts observe meaning when ability and humility amalgamate in a person whose heart will he not be able to win over as a matter of fact this young player has won the hearts of people across the globe my dear countrymen and especially my young friends what i am going to tell you now is directly for your benefit discourses and debates will continue the support and opposition will continue but if some things are checked before they proliferate then there is a huge benefit things that spawn and spread a lot are very difficult to stop at later stages but if we become aware at an early stage and put a stop to it then a lot can be saved continuing in the same vein i feel today that i should definitely have a talk with my young friends we all know that addiction to tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit this addiction people who consume tobacco are vulnerable to high risk diseases like cancer diabetes blood pressure etc everyone knows that tobacco intoxication occurs due to the nicotine present in it brain development is hampered by its consumption during adolescence but today i want to have a discourse with you on a new topic you must be knowing that recently the e cigarette got banned in india an e cigarette is a type of electronic device unlike a typical cigarette in an e cigarette the heating of nicotine containing fluids creates a type of chemical smoke and this is the pathway through which nicotine is consumed while we all understand the dangers of common cigarettes a misconception has been generated about e cigarettes the myth that has been spread is that e cigarettes pose no danger like the conventional cigarette it does not spread odour as fragrant chemicals are added to it we have seen around us that even if the father in any house is a chain smoker still he tries to stop the rest of the household from smoking and wants his children not to fall prey to the habit of cigarettes or bidis his effort is that no family member should take to smoking he knows that smoking or tobacco causes great damage to the body there is no confusion about the dangers posed by a cigarette it only causes harm and this even its seller too knows the smoker also knows this fact and so do people around but the case of e cigarettes is quite different there is little awareness among people about e cigarette they are also completely unaware of its danger and for this reason sometimes e cigarettes sneak into the house out of sheer curiosity and kids at times pretending to be showing some magical trick blow smoke in the presence of peer company or their parents without lighting a cigarette or striking a match to light it and as if a magic show is going on the family members respond with applause there is no awareness there is no knowledge that once teenagers or our youth get caught in its clutches then slowly they become hooked and fall prey to this noxious addiction and our real wealth the youth become condemned to tread on the path of waste quite unaware in fact many harmful chemicals are added to e cigarettes which have a deleterious effect on health you are aware of the fact that when someone smokes around us we come to know about it through its odour even if there is a packet of cigarettes in someone s pocket the smell can be detected however this is not the case with an e cigarette and many teenagers and young people unknowingly and sometimes proudly displaying an e cigarette as a fashion statement keep it in their books in their offices in their pockets sometimes hold it in their hands and thus fall prey to it the younger generation is the future of our country the e cigarette has been banned so that this new form of intoxication does not destroy our demographically young country it does not trample the dreams of a family and waste the lives of our children this scourge and this obnoxious habit should not become rooted in our society i urge all of you to quit the addiction to tobacco and do not harbour any misconceptions about e cigarettes come let us all build a healthy india oh yes do you still remember fit india fit india does not mean that if we go to the gym for two hours every morning and evening it will suffice all these addictions have to be avoided to be a part of fit india i am sure you will not misconstrue whatever i ve said but rather happily accept my counsel i will definitely like it my dear brothers and sisters it is a matter of great providence that our india has been the birthplace and work place of extraordinary denizens who spent all their lives not for themselves but for the good of the society our mother india our country is a bountiful land many gems of human beings took birth here india has not only been the birthplace of such extraordinary people but also the land of their karma and these are the people who have spent themselves in service of others one such illustrious indian is being honoured in vatican city on 13th october it is a matter of pride for every indian that on the coming 13thoctober his holiness pope francis will declare sister mariamthresia a saint sister mariamthresia in her short lifespan of 50 years worked for the good of humanity becoming a noble example for the entire world whatever task sister mariam thresia undertook and accomplished she did so with utmost dedication and devotion she rendered service in the fields of education and social service she had built many schools hostels and orphanages and throughout her life remained devoted to this cause she founded the congregation of the sisters of the holy family which is still continuing on the path of her life s philosophy and mission i once again pay heartfelt tributes to sister mariamthresia and congratulate the citizens of india and especially our christian brothers and sisters for this achievement my dear countrymen it is a matter of pride not only for india but for the entire world today while we are celebrating gandhi 150 our 130 crore countrymen have pledged to be rid from the menace of single use plastic in view of the kind of lead that india has taken towards environmental protection today the countries of the entire world are looking towards india as a model example i am confident that you will all be a part of the campaign for liberation from the menace of single use plastic on 2ndoctober in india citizens are contributing in this campaign in their own way but a young man from our country has initiated a very unique campaign my attention was drawn towards his work so i talked to him on the phone and tried to understand the new experiment being attempted by him it could be that this attempt of his may work for other people of our country mr ripudaman belviji is making a unique effort by attempting plogging when i first encountered the term plogging it was novel even to me perhaps this word is in usage in certain measures in foreign lands but in india ripudaman belviji has promoted it to a great extent let s talk to him pm s phone call with ripudaman belvi that is why you are worthy of praise ripudaman ji i felt nice talking to you you have designed this entire programme in a very innovative manner in a way that it will be liked especially by young people heartiest congratulation to you and friends this time on the anniversary of revered bapu the ministry of sports too is organizing a fit india plogging run on the 2nd of october plogging for two kilometers and it will be held across the country we heard through the experiences of ripudaman ji how this programme should be organised what it should consist of what we have to do in this campaign that commences on 2nd of october is that while we jog for 2 kilometers and on the way collect all kinds of plastic waste through endeavor we shall not only pay better attention to our health we shall also take a step towards ensuring protection for mother earth this campaign is resulting in raising awareness levels in people as far as sanitation and cleanliness along with fitness levels i do believe that a single step towards freedom from single use plastic taken by 130 crore countrymen will give india a lead by a 130 crore steps ripudaman ji once again many thanks to you and to your team and your imaginative innovative bent of mind heartiest congratulations from my side thank you my dear countrymen groundwork for 2nd october is going on all over the country and also the world over but we want to transmute gandhi 150 as a task on the path of our duty we want to move forward devoting our lives in the interest of the nation i would like to remind you one thing in advance although in the next episode of mann ki baat i shall dwell upon it in detail still today i am telling this in advance so that you get time to prepare you do remember that 31stoctober is the birth anniversary of sardar vallabhbhai patel and that ek bharat shreshtha bharat is our common dream hence for that reason every year on 31 october we run for fostering unison in the country as run for unity all over the nation we have to run for the unity of the country on that day in in large numbers elders everyone schools colleges all of us have to run for unity in lakhs of villages across the span of hindustan so better start preparing from this instant onwards i shall talk about it in detail later but right now we have time on our hands some people can begin their practice whereas some can chalk out a plan my dear countrymen you will remember that on 15 august i had in my address said from the ramparts of red fort that by 2022 you should visit 15 tourist destinations in india at least 15 places and if possible make a program to stay over there for an overnight two night stay you should observe understand and experience india we have so much diversity and when holidays come in the shape of diwali and allied festivals people do travel and that s why i urge you to visit any 15 such places in india my dear countrymen the 27th of september two days prior to today was celebrated as world tourism day and you will be happy to know that certain reputed tourism agencies of the world which rank standards of travel tourism have shown that india has displayed a lot of improvement in the travel tourism competitive index and all this has been possible due to your cooperation and especially because understanding the importance of tourism has increased the swachhata abhiyan also has a big role to play in all of this and you will be delighted to know that today our rank is thirty four on this index whereas five years ago we were ranked 65th which in a way is a big jump if we tried all that harder then by the 75th year of our independence we would have carved a place for ourselves amidst the major tourist destinations of the world my dear countrymen once again i wish you all the best for various festivals that will be celebrated in the oncoming season in india which is filled with diversity yes also please see to it that during the celebration of diwali firecrackers do not lead to incidents of fire or loss of a life whatever precautions or preventive care is to be taken should be taken during diwali happiness should co exist with joy and of course there must also be enthusiasm and our festivals do indeed bring the aroma of collectiveness and also the rituals connected with communal harmony symbiotic living provides us with renewed vigour and the festive season is the symbol of the culmination of that renewed vigour come together brimming with enthusiasm renewed dreams and resolutions we should celebrate once again here s wishing many felicitations to you all thank you she is one of the most accomplished and humble

it is silent and equally lethal mannkibaat during mannkibaat i spoke to the phenomenal ripudaman ji who is improving both fitness and cleanliness levels through his efforts have a look it does not happen often that the world discusses the runner up as much as the winner that is why when daniilmedwed s speech at the usopen was widely discussed i decided to hear it myself and it really touched my heart mannkibaat this festive season have you thought about delivery in and delivery out pm narendramodi talks about this idea during mannkibaat as a means to spread joy let us make this festive

30-Apr-17,"In this episode of ""Mann Ki Baat"" from April 30, 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expresses his gratitude for the valuable suggestions and feedback he receives from the citizens of India. He acknowledges the efforts of people who are striving to make a positive impact on society and emphasizes the importance of collective action. PM Modi discusses the need to beat the summer heat and care for birds during this season. He encourages the youth to make the most of their summer vacations by gaining new experiences and skills. He suggests that young people engage with society, help those less privileged, and learn new things. The Prime Minister also highlights the government's efforts to promote digital payments and encourages citizens to participate in the Refer and Earn scheme. PM Modi talks about the removal of red beacons from VIP vehicles and the significance of according importance to every individual. He also mentions the celebrations of the thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya and the upcoming Labour Day. The Prime Minister concludes by discussing the South Asia Satellite project, which aims to promote regional development and cooperation, and offers his best wishes for the hot weather and the well-being of all citizens.",30-apr-2017 my dearest countrymen namaskar before each episode of mann ki baat suggestions pour in aakashvani on narendramodiapp come through on mygov by the phone and come by the means of recorded messages from every corner of the country and people of every age group and sometimes when i take the time to view them for me it becomes an extremely pleasant experience one comes across such a wide spectrum of information one finds that every corner of the country is filled with talented people like a selfless seeker these countless people are consumed by desire to contribute something to the society on the other hand there are mounds of problems that perhaps even the government does not notice maybe the system has also become accustomed in dealing with these problems and so do have the people become accustomed to them i have come across the inquisitiveness of children the ambitions of the youth and the gist of the experience of elders myriad kind of facts emerges every time the inputs that come in response to every episode of mann ki baat are analyzed in detail by the government what are the kinds of suggestions what are the kinds of complaints and what are the experiences of the people it is an inherent human nature to advise others while travelling in the train or the bus if someone coughs the next person immediately advises a cure to offer advice or suggest a solution are part of our nature in the beginning when suggestions came in response to a certain episode of mann ki baat one could discern words of advice and you could read them too so our team always felt that many people might have had this particular habit of proffering advice but when we analyzed the suggestions minutely i really became quite emotional most of those who give suggestions or try to reach to me are those who are really doing something in their lives they are making efforts and are engrossed as per their intellect capacity ability and circumstances so that something good must happen and when these things came to my notice i felt that these suggestions are extraordinary these are suggestions that have emerged out of a certain squeeze of life s experiences some people also give suggestions thinking that if an idea has the potential to work then more people would listen to it if it is heard on a wider platform and hence many people can benefit and therefore it is their natural desire that it gets a mention in mann ki baat according to me all of these things are extremely positive steps first of all i express my gratitude to the karma yogis and those people who have offered some or the other service to the society and recommend maximum suggestions and not only this when i mention something positive such memories come to recall it is very much a pleasant experience in the previous mann ki baat some people had suggested to me that food was being wasted not only had i expressed my concern but mentioned it too and upon my mention there were mentions of many innovative ideas to save food from being wasted that are being put into practice employed in many corners of the country on narendramodiapp and also on mygov i had never even imagined that in our country especially the young generation has been doing this kind of work from a long time some social institutions have been involved in this activity for many years was common knowledge but the youth of my country are engaged in this task i only came to know later many have sent me the videos of their work in this field there are many places where roti banks are operating in the roti banks the leftover rotis are deposited by people they also deposit the leftover vegetables and the needy can obtain food from these banks the person who donates rotis feels a sense of satisfaction also the recipient also does not feel humiliated these are examples of how work can be achieved with the help of society today is the last day of month of april 1st may is the foundation day of the states of gujarat and maharashtra on this occasion many felicitations to the citizens of these two states on my behalf both states have made constant strides to scale newer heights of development and have contributed toward the advancement of the country and both the states had a steady stream of great men whose lives and sterling contributions in every sphere of society is a source of inspiration for us in remembrance of these great men on the foundation day of these two states we should take the pledge of taking our state our country our society our city and our family to glorious heights in 2022 when we celebrate 75 years of independence plans should be drawn to achieve that pledge and taken forward with the cooperation of all citizens i wish the very best to these two states there used to be a time when climate change was a subject confined to the domain of the academic world it used to be the topic for seminars but today we experience it in our everyday life and it also astounds us nature has also changed the rules of the game the heat that we used to experience in months of may june in our country is being felt in march april this year so when i was taking suggestions for mann ki baat most of the suggestions offered related to what should be done to beat the heat during summer time most of the suggestions or practices to beat summer are not new but are prevalent for a long time however it is very useful to remember them from time to time shri prashant kumar mishra shri t s kartik and many such friends have expressed their concern about birds during the summer they ve mentioned that water should be kept in trays and utensils on the balcony and on the terrace i have seen that small children of the family do this very enthusiastically once they understand why they should fill the pots with water they would go and inspect 10 times in a day to ensure there is water in the tray and also watch if the birds came or not we think as if it is a game going on but in actuality this is a novel way of instilling empathy in the child s mind you can also experience for yourself that a little attachment to an animal or a bird makes you feel very happy some time back shri mr jagat bhai from gujarat had sent his book save the sparrows in which he not only expressed concern about the continuously declining number of sparrows but also what steps he has taken in a mission mode for the conservation of the sparrow which is very nicely described in that book in our country we are traditionally imbued with a sense of symbiotic co existence with animals birds and nature yet it is necessary that collective efforts in this regard should be emphasized when i was chief minister of gujarat syedna sahib the religious leader of dawoodi bohra community had completed his hundred years he lived till 103 years as part of the celebration of his 100th year the bohra community society had launched a huge campaign to save the sparrow under the aegis of burhani foundation i had the opportunity to inaugurate it nearly 52 thousand bird feeders were distributed in every nook and corner of the world this effort also found a mention in the guinness book of world records sometimes we are so busy that we even forget to offer water to the newspaper boy the milkman the vegetable seller the postman or anybody else who come to our house in peak summer days young friends i want to have a chat with you too i am sometimes worried that much of our younger generation prefer leading life in their comfort zones parents also raise their children in a very protective manner true there are other extremes also but most are brought up in this comfort zone syndrome now the examinations have ended and you must be done with your plans to enjoy the vacation summer vacations feel good inspite of scorching heat but as a friend i want to suggest you certain tips about of how to utilize your vacation i believe some people will put them to use and they will tell me about that too would you like to use this time of vacation gainfully i offer three suggestions it will be good if you follow all of the three but then try to do atleast one of the three see that you gain a new experience try to take the opportunity of acquiring a new skill try to experience something that you have neither heard before nor seen nor thought of and yet there is a curiosity in your mind you must try new places new experiences and new skills there is huge difference between to sometime to see something on television or reading about it in the book or listening about it from acquaintances and to experiencing the same thing yourself i will urge you to try to experience and satiate your curiosity on any subject during this vacation try a new experiment the experiment must be positive and a little out of your comfort zone we all belong to the middle class and happy comfortable families friends have you ever thought of travelling in a second class railway compartment without a reservation and going for atleast a 24 hours ride what great experience it will be how are the lives of your co passengers what do they do at the station when they alight from the train what you cannot learn in a year you will learn in that crowded train travelling without any reservation for 24 hours you might not get to sleep and have to travel standing try it just experience it once i am not asking you to try it again and again do it once in the evening take your football or your volleyball or any other sports item and go to a colony of poor and lesser privileged people play with those poor kids you will experience a new kind of joy the kind you would have never experienced in your life before that s the kind of joy you ll experience have you ever thought what changes would come in the lives of those kids who live in abject poverty when get the opportunity to play with you and i believe that if you go there once your heart will tell you to go back again and again this experience will teach you a lot many volunteer organizations are engaged in this kind of work you are connected to google guru try searching on it and get associated with any such organization for 15 days or 20 days go explore go to the jungles sometimes there are summer camps for development of different facets of your personality you can participate in these camps but at the same time don t you feel that after you ve attended such summer camps you have participated in the courses for development of personality and you reach out to those people who have no such opportunity and teach them what you have learned without taking any money it is possible that you can teach them i am also worried that technology evolved to reduce the distance technology came in to being to end the boundaries but the end result of this is that six people in the same house are sitting in the same room but they are separated by unimaginable distances why everyone has become so busy with technology in his or her own way collectivity is also a way of life collectivity is power in itself secondly i had mentioned about skill acquisition don t you feel that you should learn something new today is the era of competition you get so submerged in the preparation for the examinations get so consumed to obtain the best grades there are coaching classes going on even in vacations and you re worrying about the next exam sometimes you feel scared that our youth have become robot like living life like a machine friends dreams of making it big in life is a good thing it is good to have some purpose in life and you must achieve your goals but also self evaluate whether the human element within yourself is getting frustrated are we not moving away from our human qualities can t a little emphasis be given on this aspect in skill development get away from technology and try to spend some time with yourself learn a musical instrument or learn a few sentences of a new language tamil telugu assamese bengali malayalam gujarati marathi or punjabi this is a country full of diversity and if you look then there can be someone who can teach us something new is just around the corner if you don t know how to swim then learn swimming try doing some drawing even if you do not end up making the best drawing try to practice putting hand to the paper the empathy within you will begin to appear sometimes if our heart desires to learn the trade of so called small people then let us learn it why not you want to learn to drive a car but then do you ever want to learn how to drive an auto rickshaw you re able to ride a bicycle but have you ever tried to operate the three wheeler cycle or rickshaw which transports people you see all these new experiments these skills are such that they will bring you joy and will remove you from the limitations of life to which you re tied down do something out of the box my friends this is the only time to make something of your life and if you think that after appearing in all exams at a new threshold of your career you will learn some new skill then you won t get a chance at that time you will be tangled into other things and therefore i tell you if you have a passion to learn magic then learn the card tricks keep showing the tricks to your friends try to know about things about which you have no prior knowledge it will definitely benefit you your inner human potential will awaken and this will provide a great opportunity for development i can tell you from my experience of going around the world that the amount we can learn by seeing the world is something we cannot even imagine new places new cities new towns new villages new areas but before leaving for a particular place preparing for the journey and upon reaching your destination gathering information about it like a seeker of knowledge understanding about the place and having discussions with the local people if you make an effort in this manner then the pleasure of visiting the particular place would be something else do try to do it of course do not travel too much in one go go to a destination and spend three to four days there then go to the next and spend a like duration there you will get to learn a lot that way i wish you share your travel photographs with me it will be nice what new did you see where did you travel to make good use of the hash tag incredible india and share your experiences friends this time around the government of india has provided you with a great opportunity the new generation is more or less freeing itself from the shackles of cash it does not need cash it has begun adopting digital currency i know you do it but have you ever wondered that you can earn using this very scheme it is a scheme of the government of india you must be downloading the bhim app and using it but do refer it to others make others join you in that if the new member does three transactions performs financial business thrice you stand to earn ten rupees for that ten rupees will be credited to your account from the government if you involve twenty persons in a day by evening you would ve earned two hundred rupees the traders can earn so can students and this scheme is valid till the 14th of october it will be your contribution towards making of a digital india you ll become a sentinel of new india the joy of a vacation coupled with income refer and earn generally speaking in our country there exists an atmosphere of disdain towards the vip culture but that it runs so very deep i just experienced when the government recently decided that no person in india whatsoever his status might be will not move with a red beacon atop his vehicle in a way it had become a symbol of the vip culture experience tells us that whereas the red beacon used to be fixed atop the vehicle atop the car slowly steadily it permeated into the psyche and got firmly entrenched in the mindset the red beacon now has gone for good but nobody can say with certainty that the same in the mindset has also disappeared i have received a very interesting phone call though the caller has expressed the same apprehension one can discern from this phone call that common men detest these tendencies they feel distanced namaskar pradhan mantri ji i am shivaa choubey calling from jabalpur madhya pradesh i wish to say something on the government s ban on red beacons i read a line in a newspaper every indian is a vip on the road it made me feel very proud i am glad that today even my time is equally important i don t have to be caught in a traffic jam and i don t have to stop for anyone as well i want to thank you from the core of my heart for this decision and the swachch bharat campaign that you have launched will not only clean our country it will get rid of the vip hegemony from our roads many thanks for that the exit of the red beacon through a government decision is part of a system but we have to make efforts to cleanse it out of our minds if we collectively strive to do it with eternal vigilance it surely can be flushed out our concept of new india precisely is that in place of vip more priority should be accorded to epi and when i m saying epi in place of vip the essence of my sentiment is clear every person is important every person has his or her own importance every person possesses a sagacious aura mahaatmya in a unique manner let us warmly accept the importance of a hundred twenty five crore countrymen let us respectfully embrace the mahaatmya the divine greatness of a hundred twenty five crore indians and we ll garner strength of immense magnitude we have to do this together my dear countrymen i maintain time again that we should keep re visiting the annals of our history traditions and culture that lends us energy and inspiration this year we the hundred twenty five crore countrymen are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of saint ramanujacharya for one reason or the other we confine ourselves to celebrating and observing centenaries of events mostly for other countries of the world a century may be of immense significance but india is such an ancient nation that we are the proud inheritors of thousands and thousands of years of heritage knowledge and civilized existence and have an opportunity to observe and celebrate a memorial heritage of over thousand years just try and imagine it even today breaking the shackles social orthodoxy is so difficult how would society be a thousand years ago what kind of a mindset would be prevalent then not many would know that ramanujacharya relentlessly struggled against rampant social evils such as the class divide the chasm between touchable and untouchables and the caste system through his own conduct he embraced those who were ostracized by society a thousand years ago he launched an agitation allowing their entry into temples and succeeded in facilitating the same we are indeed fortunate that in every era for eradicating social evils noble souls great men were born in this society itself now that we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of ramanujacharya we

occasion of dedication to the nation of his collection of vachana amrit the elixir of his spoken words in the 12th century he had laid down his profound thoughts on labour workers he had mentioned in kannada kaay kave kailas it means it is just through your perseverance that you can obtain kailash the abode of shiva this means it is only endeavour or karma that leads you to attain swarga or heaven in other words labour hard work is shiva i repeatedly mention shrameva jayate and dignity of labour i distinctly remember the words of shriman dattopant thengdi the founder of bharatiya mazdoor sangh

letters from all of you lakhs of messages and i have tried to read as many letters as possible have a look at them and try to understand the messages a bit many a time while reading your letters i got emotional was filled with emotions got carried away in emotions and then also composed myself you have congratulated me on the 100th episode of mann ki baat but i say this from the core of my heart that in fact all of you the listeners of mann ki baat our countrymen deserve congratulations mann ki baat is the mann ki baat of crores of indians it is the expression of their feelings friends the 3rd of october 2014 was the festival of vijaya dashami and all of us together started the journey of mann ki baat on the day of vijaya dashami vijaya dashami is the festival of victory of good over evil mann ki baat has also become a unique festival of goodness and positivity of the countrymen a festival that comes every month keenly awaited by all of us we celebrate positivity in this we also celebrate people s participation in this sometimes it is hard to believe that so many months so many years have passed since mann ki baat commenced every episode was special in itself every time the novelty of new examples every time the extension of new successes of the countrymen in mann ki baat people from every corner of the country people of all age groups joined whether it is about beti bachao beti padhao or the swachh bharat movement love for khadi or nature whether it is the azadi ka amrit mahotsav or amrit sarovar any subject with which mann ki baat got associated turned into a mass movement and you people have made it so when i jointly shared mann ki baat with the then us president barack obama it was discussed all over the world friends for me mann ki baat has been like worshipping the qualities in others i had a guide shri laxmanrao ji inamdar we used to address him as vakeel saheb he always used to say that we should worship the qualities of others no matter who is face to face with you be it your compatriot be it your opponent we should try to know about their good qualities and learn from them this trait of his has always inspired me mann ki baat has become a great medium to learn from the qualities of others my dear countrymen this program has never let me be away from you i remember when i was the chief minister of gujarat it was natural to meet and interact with the common people there the work and tenure of the chief minister is like that there are many opportunities to come together but after coming to delhi in 2014 i found that life here was very different the nature of the work is different the responsibility is different one is bound by circumstances the rigours of security time limits in the initial days something felt different there was an emptiness fifty years ago i did not leave my home just to find one day it would be difficult to contact the people of my own country the very countrymen who are my everything i could not live separated from them mann ki baat gave me a solution to this challenge a way to connect with the common man the post and protocol remained limited to the system and public sentiment along with crores of people became an inseparable part of my inner world every month i read thousands of messages from the people of the country every month i get to view one or the other wonderful manifestation of the countrymen i see and feel the extremities of the penance and sacrifice of the countrymen i just don t feel that i am even a little far from you for me mann ki baat is not a program for me it is a matter of faith of worship or vrat like when people go to worship god they bring along a thaal of prasad for me mann ki baat is like a thaal of prasad at the feet of god in the form of janata janardan the people mann ki baat has become a spiritual journey of my being mann ki baat is a journey from the self to the collective mann ki baat is a journey from myself to ourselves it is not me but you are its sanskar sadhana imagine some of our countrymen have been planting trees on deserted hills and barren land for 40 odd years many people have been digging stepwells and ponds for water conservation for 30 odd years cleaning them as well some have been teaching underprivileged children for 25 30 years some are helping in the treatment of the poor i have become emotional while mentioning them many a time in mann ki baat friends from air had to re record it many times today a lot from the past is coming in front of my eyes these efforts of the countrymen have inspired me to continuously keep striving friends the people who we mention in mann ki baat are all our heroes who have made this program come alive today when we have reached the milestone of the 100th episode i also wish that we once again go to all these heroes to know about their journey today we will also try to talk to some colleagues brother sunil jaglan of haryana is joining me sunil jaglan ji has had such an impact on my mind because there used to be a lot of discussion on gender ratio in haryana and i also started the campaign of beti bachao beti padhao from haryana itself and meanwhile when i came across sunil ji s selfie with daughter campaign i felt very happy i also learned from him and included it in mann ki baat in no time selfie with daughter turned into a global campaign and the issue in this was neither selfie nor technology importance was accorded to the daughter the importance of a daughter in life also comes to the fore through this campaign the result of many such efforts is that today

achieved in the past 60 years would it be possible to achieve it in such a small span of time many questions were being raised but i am happy to tell you that all the units of the government and all the banks put in tremendous effort and as per my knowledge till date close to 18 crore people have opened their bank accounts 17 crore 74 lakh to be precise i saw the richness of the poor they had to open zero balance accounts but these poor people saved money and deposited a sum of 22 000 crores banks are the mainstream of the economy and to reach this facility to the homes of the poor the programme of bank mitra is being strengthened today more than 1 25 lakh bank mitras are serving in the country the youth have got employment this way you will be pleased to know that in this one year to connect the banking sector economy and the poor people over 1 lakh 31 thousand financial literacy camps have been organized one just does not have to open account and get stuck thousands of people under the jan dhan yojana are now eligible to take an overdraft and they have availed it too now the poor have this faith that they too can get money from the bank i would again like to congratulate all the people associated with this initiative and i would like to request the poor brethren who have opened an account to never severe this relationship these are your banks and now you should never leave them i have brought them to you now it is your job to keep them going all of our accounts should be kept active i have the faith that you will definitely continue operating the bank accounts in the past few days the events in gujarat the violence unsettled the entire country it is natural that if something of this sort happens in the land of mahatma and sardar patel then the nation is definitely shocked and hurt but in a very short span of time the intelligent brothers and sisters of mine in gujarat brought the entire situation under control they played an important role in preventing the situation form worsening further and once again gujarat started its peaceful march peace unity and brotherhood is the right way forward we have to walk together towards the path of development development is the key to our problems sometime back i had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the sufi tradition i had the opportunity to hear them speak and truly speaking of the experience and the manner in which they presented their views sounded as if some music was being played their choice of words their way of talking the generosity of the sufi tradition its sublimity its lyricism i could experience it all i felt very nice i think it has become imperative to present islam in its true form to the world i am confident that the sufi tradition which is associated with love and generosity will take this message far and wide and will thus benefit not only the humanity but also benefit islam and i would like to tell all that whatever faith one follows we should definitely experience sufism once i am about to get another opportunity in the coming days and i consider myself fortunate to receive this invitation various buddhist scholars from across the globe are coming together at bodh gaya and will discuss issues relating to humanity at a global level i have been extended an invitation to be a part of this event and i am glad to be invited at bodh gaya pandit nehru the first prime minister of india visited bodh gaya and now i will be going there with these scholars this gives me immense happiness my dear farmer brothers and sisters today i would again like to especially share my mann ki baat with you i have already mentioned this in the previous sessions of mann ki baat you must have heard me speak in the parliament in public forums or mann ki baat about it i have always said that the government is open to all views and suggestions on the issue of land acquisition act on which a debate is going on i have reiterated again and again that i am open to any suggestion in the interest of the farmers but today i want to tell all my farmer brothers and sisters that the request to reform the land acquisition act was raised by the states very emphatically everyone felt that if the welfare of the farmers is to be achieved if the water has to reach the fields if poles are to be erected to provide electricity if roads have to be constructed in the village if houses are to be made for the poor in the village if employment opportunities are to be provided to the poor youth of rural areas then we have to free the land from legal hassles and bureaucratic hurdles and hence this reformed proposal was introduced but i saw how the framers were being misled and a fear psychosis created my dear farmers you should not be misled and definitely never be scared and i do not wish to give anyone the opportunity to mislead you and scare you for me every single voice in the nation is important but most important to me is the voice of the farmer we had issued an ordinance tomorrow on august 31st the deadline for this ordinance ends i have decided that let this ordinance be lapsed this means that now same situation exists as it was prior to the formation of my government but in the same act there was a job which was incomplete this job was related to 13 points which were to be completed within a year and so we brought the ordinance but due to these disputes the issue got stuck the ordinance is coming to an end but those 13 points which were to benefit farmers which is directly connected to the monetary issues of the farmers will be made into a law and will be implemented today itself so that the farmers do not suffer any losses especially monetary losses and hence the task of implementing the 13 points which was left incomplete in the earlier act is being accomplished today i want to reassure my farmer brothers and sisters that jai jawan jai kisan is not merely a slogan it is our guiding mantra the guiding mantra is the welfare of the villages and the poor farmers that is why i declared on 15th august that it is not just an agricultural department but an agricultural and farmer welfare department will be created we are steadily working on it so my dear farmers there is no need to be misled now and especially there is no need for you to fear anything do not be scared even if someone tries to scare you i have to say something more two days back we completed the 50 years of the 1965 war and whenever we talk of the 65 war it is natural that we remember lal bahadur shastri it is also but natural that we remember his slogan jai jawan jai kisan it is also natural that we remember our jawans who sacrificed their lives to maintain the pride and honour of our tricolor flag i salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war i pay my tribute to the brave soldiers may we continue to be inspired by such incidents of our history like i had the chance of meeting the sufi scholars similarly i had another great experience i had the opportunity to interact for hours with the distinguished scientists of the country i had the opportunity to hear them and i was very happy to know that india is doing commendable research in the field of science our scientists are doing some excellent work now the challenge is to take these researches to the common man how to convert these theories into machineries how to connect laboratory to the land we have to take this forward as an opportunity i got a lot of new information i can say that it was both inspiring and educative experience for me and i saw how the young scientists were eager to explain their work and their eyes were full of dreams in the previous episode of mann ki baat i had expressed the view that our students should be drawn towards science after this meeting i felt that there are numerous options and endless possibilities i would like to reiterate once again that our young friends take interest in science and our educational institutions should also encourage the students for the same i receive many letters from the citizens mr parimal shah from thane talks about educational reforms on my portal mygov in they have written about skill development mr prakash tripathi from chidambaram in tamil nadu emphasizes the need for good teachers at primary level they have emphasized on reforms in the educational set ups i especially want to make a point to my young friends i had mentioned from the red fort that why should there be interviews for the lower posts and when they do get the interview letter the poor the widowed mother start thinking who to reach for recommendation who can help get the job whose jack could be useful to get that job i do not know what all kind of words are being used every one rushes and that seems to be one reason for corruption at the lower levels i had mentioned in my speech on 15th august 2015 that this tradition of interview should at least end at some level i am happy that in such a short span of time it has just been 15 days but the government is moving at a very fast pace information is being disseminated and soon the decision will be enforced and small jobs will be made free of interviews now the poor will not have to run for recommendation this will end exploitation and corruption these days many guests from foreign countries have arrived in india 24 countries from across the globe discussed on the indian soil a call to action to reduce maternal mortality and infant mortality rates it was the first time that this programme was organized in any other country outside america and it is true that in our country about 50 000 mothers and almost 13 lakh children die during delivery or immediately after it every year this is a cause of worry and these figures are scary although a lot of improvement has taken place india is being appreciated at the international level for its efforts but this statistics is not low like we became polio free similarly we became free from tetanus as a cause of maternal and child mortality the world has accepted this but we still have to work to save our mothers and our children dear countrymen there is news of dengue everywhere it is true that dengue is dangerous but prevention of dengue is easier it is directly related to the swachh bharat campaign that i talk about we watch the advertisement on tv but do not pay attention there are advertisements in the newspapers but it escapes our attention there are several ways of keeping the smallest thing in the household clean by using pure water a lot of public education programmes are being conducted but we do not pay attention we feel that we live in very good houses with proper arrangements being totally unaware that water is collecting at some location in the house and that we are inviting dengue i would request you all that do not make death so cheap life is very precious a little carelessness about cleanliness and accumulated water can cause death which i believe is not right in the entire country about 514 centers have facilities for testing dengue cases absolutely free of cost it is necessary to get ourselves tested on time to save precious lives cooperation from all of you is very important for this menace and cleanliness should be given great importance from raksha bandhan to diwali there will be many festivals why don t we associate each festival with cleaniness you will see how a tradition becomes your habit my dear countrymen i want to share good news with you like i said we may not get a chance to die for our nation but we can be fortunate to live for the country there are two young brothers and that too from nashik in our own state of maharashtra dr hitendra mahajan and dr mahendra mahajan both with a keen desire to help our tribal population these two brothers have brought pride to the nation in america a difficult cycle race of about 4800 kms known as race across america is organized this year both these brothers have won this race they have made us proud i would like to congratulate both these brothers and send my best wishes but i was happier to know that they do all this for their campaign team india vision for tribals see everyone is doing their bit for taking the country forward and this it when you hear such things the heart swells with pride sometimes we do injustice to our youth guided by a certain perception the old generation feels that the new generation does not understand anything and i understand that this has been going on for ages my experience regarding youth is different sometimes when we talk to the youth we learn so many things i have met so many youth who have taken the pledge sunday on cycle some say that i keep one day a week as cycle day as it is good for my health it is good for the environment and i enjoy my youth too nowadays many cities in our country are witnessing cycle use and there are many people promoting its use but this is a good initiative both for improving health and saving the environment and today when two youths of my country made india proud in the us i thought of it worth mentioning today i especially want to congratulate the maharashtra government it makes me happy the task for erecting a memorial for baba sahib ambedkar in the indu mill compounds had been stuck for long the new government in maharashtra completed this task and now a grand memorial will be erected which will inspire us to work for the dalits exploited and the marginalized but along with this the house in uk where baba saheb lived 10 king henry road has been purchased too the globetrotting indians on their trip to uk can visit the memorial being erected by the maharashtra government it will be inspirational to many i congratulate the maharashtra government on the accomplishment of both these tasks my dear brothers and sisters do share your views before the next mann ki baat for i believe that democracy runs through public participation we can take the nation forward when we work together i send my best wishes to you thank you tune in at 11 am mannkibaat mannkibaat radio programme begins in a short while you can also

celebrated the holy festival of raksha bandhan the government of india has launched various schemes of social security for the common man i am happy that in a very short span of time all these schemes have been accepted in large numbers i had made a humble request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan we give our sisters these insurance schemes as a gift i saw the richness of the poor they had to open zero balance accounts but these poor people saved money and deposited a sum of 22 000 crores banks are the mainstream of the economy and to reach this facility to the homes of the people the programme of bank mitra is being strengthened today close to 18 crore people have opened their bank accounts 17 crore 74 lakh to be precise
30-Aug-20,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on August 30, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the unique challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the discipline and responsibility displayed by the Indian citizens during festivals, such as Ganeshotsav, celebrated online and with eco-friendly idols. He also emphasized the deep connection between Indian festivals and nature, sharing a tradition of the Thaaru tribal community in Bihar called ""Barna,"" which enforces a lockdown to protect nature. The Prime Minister lauded Indian farmers for their perseverance, citing increased sowing of crops even amid the pandemic. He introduced the idea of promoting Indian toy production and urged start-ups and entrepreneurs to participate in making high-quality, eco-friendly toys. He emphasized that toys should encourage creativity and be favorable for the environment. Additionally, he encouraged the development of games based on Indian themes and history. The Prime Minister called upon citizens to embrace the movement for self-reliant India and mentioned the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat App innovation challenge. He also highlighted the importance of nutrition, announcing that September would be observed as Nutrition Month. Furthermore, he praised Indian breed dogs serving in security forces and called for their adoption as pets. Finally, the Prime Minister encouraged teachers and students to explore the history of the freedom struggle at a local level, engaging in research, visits, and creative work to honor unsung heroes, especially with the 75th year of India's independence approaching.",30-aug-2020 my dear countrymen namaskar generally this period is full of festivals fairs are held at various places it s the time for religious ceremonies too during these times of corona crises on the one hand people are full of exaltation and enthusiasm too and yet in a way there s also a discipline that touches our heart broadly speaking in a way there is a feeling of responsibility amongst citizens people are getting along with their day to day tasks while taking care of themselves and others as well at every event being organised in the country the kind of patience and simplicity being witnessed this time is unprecedented even ganeshotsav is being celebrated online at certain places at most places eco friendly ganesh idols have been installed friends if we observe very minutely one thing will certainly draw our attention our festivals and the environment there has always been a deep connect between the two on the one hand our festivals implicitly convey the message of co existence with the environment and nature on the other many festivals are celebrated precisely for protecting nature for example in west champaran district of bihar people belonging to thaaru tribal community have been observing a sixty hour lockdown for centuries in their own words saath ghante ke barna the thaaru community has adopted barna as a tradition for protection of nature that too for centuries during this period neither does anyone enter the village nor leave home and they believe that if they step out or if someone enters from elsewhere the to and fro movement along with other routine activities of people can lead to the destruction of new plants and trees our tribal brothers and sisters begin the barna lockdown with a grand worship and conclude with jestful traditional tribal songs music and dance programmes friends these days the festival of onam is also being celebrated with gaiety and fervour this festival arrives in the month of chingam during this period people buy something new decorate their homes prepare pookalam and enjoy onam saadiya variety of games and competitions are also held the zest of onam today has reached distant shores of foreign lands be it america europe or gulf countries the verve of onam can be felt everywhere onam is increasingly turning out to be an international festival friends onam is a festival linked with our agriculture it is also the time of a new beginning for our rural economy our lives our society derive sustenance from the fortitude of farmers their perseverance lends myriad hues to our festivals in the vedas too our food provider annadaata the life sustaining shakti of our farmers has been gloriously venerated there is a mantra in rigved annanam patayenamah kshetranam patayenamah which means bow to the food provider salute to the farmer even during these trying times of corona our farmers have proven their mettle this time around in our country sowing of kharif crops has increased by 7 percent compared to last year the sowing of paddy has increased by approximately 10 percent pulses close to 5 percent coarse cereals almost 3 percent oilseeds around 13 percent and cotton nearly 3 percent for this i extend felicitations to the farmers of our country i salute their perseverance my dear countrymen during this time period of corona the country is fighting on many fronts simultaneously but at the same time the question that frequently comes to mind is how my young little friends are spending their time while they remain homebound for so long and this is why i together with the children university of gandhinagar a unique experiment in the world indian government s ministry of women and child development ministry of education ministry of micro small and medium enterprises pondered and deliberated over what we can do for our children it was a very useful and pleasant experience for me because in a way it became an opportunity for me to know and learn something new friends the subject that we contemplated over was toys and especially indian toys we discussed how to make new toys available to the children of india how india could become a big hub of toy production by the way i apologize to the parents listening to mann ki baat as after this they might face an additional task of hearing out new demands for toys friends whereas toys augment activity they also give flight to our aspirations toys not only entertain they also build the mind and foster an intent too i read somewhere what gurudev rabindranath tagore had said about toys the best toy is that which is incomplete a toy that children together complete while playing gurudev tagore had said that during his childhood he used to make his own toys and games with his friends with materials available at home using his own imagination but one day elders interfered with those fun filled moments of childhood it so happened that one of his friends brought a big and beautiful foreign toy now all their attention was more on flaunting the toy than the game that toy became the centre of attraction for everyone not the game the child who hitherto used to play and mingle with everyone and remain immersed in the game the same child started to act aloof in a way the feeling of being distinct from the rest of the children took over his mind in that expensive toy there was nothing to create nor was there anything to learn that is an appealing toy had subdued veiled and withered a brilliant child this toy exuded pomposity it exhibited wealth and a little nobility but it curtailed the growth and grooming of the child s creative spirit the toy remained but the game was over and the blossoming of the child stopped too therefore gurudev used to say that toys should be such that they bring out the childhood of a child and also his or her creativity in the national education policy a lot of attention has been given on the impact of toys on different aspects of children s lives learning while playing learning to make toys visiting toy factories all these have been made part of the curriculum friends there has been a rich tradition of local toys in our country there are many talented and skilled artisans who possess expertise in making good toys some parts of india are developing also as toy clusters that is as centres of toys like channapatna in ramnagaram in karnataka kondaplli in krishna in andhra pradesh thanjavur in tamilnadu dhubari in assam varanasi in uttar pradesh there are many such places we can count many names you will be surprised to know that the global toy industry is of more than 7 lakh crore rupees such a big business of 7 lakh crore rupees but india s share is very little in this now just spare a thought for a nation which has so much of heritage tradition variety young population will it feel good to have such little share in the toy market not at all you too won t feel good after hearing this friends the toy industry is very vast be it cottage industries small industries msmes and along with this big industries and private entrepreneurs too come in the ambit of this the country will have to persevere together to promote this further like there is mr c v raju in vishakhapatnam of andhra pradesh once the eti koppakaa toys of his village were very popular the speciality of these toys these were made of wood and secondly you would not find any angles or corners in these toys anywhere these toys were round from all sides hence there was no scope for injury to children c v raju has now started a sort of a new movement for eti koppakaa toys along with the artisans of his village by making excellent quality eti koppakaa toys c v raju has brought back the lost glory of these local toys we can do two things through toys bring back the glorious past in our lives and also spruce up our golden future to my start up friends to our new entrepreneurs i say team up for toys let us make toys together for everybody it is the time to get vocal for local toys come let us make some good quality toys for our youth toys should be such that in their presence childhood blooms and smiles let us make toys which are favourable to the environment too friends similarly in this era of computers and smartphones there is a big trend of computer games these games are played by children and grownups as well but even in these games their themes are mostly extraneous our country has so many ideas so many concepts our history has been very rich can we make games based on that i call upon the young talent of the country make games in india and make games based on india too it is also said let the game begin so let us start the game friends be it virtual games be it the sector of toys in the self reliant india campaign all have to play very important role and therein lies an opportunity too a hundred years ago when the non cooperation movement started gandhi ji had written non cooperation movement is an effort to make countrymen realise their self respect and their power today when we are trying to make the country self reliant we have to move with full confidence and make the country self reliant in every area a seed that was sown in the form of the non cooperation movement it is now the responsibility of all of us to transform it into banyan tree of self reliant india my dear countrymen everyone acknowledges the capability of indians to offer innovation and solutions when there is dedication and sensitivity this power becomes limitless at the beginning of this month an app innovation challenge was put before the youth of the country our youth participated enthusiastically in this aatma nirbhar bharat app innovation challenge around 7 thousand entries were received of these too nearly two thirds have been made by the youth of tier two and tier three cities this is a very auspicious indication for self reliant india for future of the country you will definitely be impressed on seeing the results of the aatma nirbhar bharat app innovation challenge after a lot of scrutiny awards have been given to around two dozen apps in different categories do familiarise yourselves with these apps and connect with them it is possible that you too get inspired to make something like that among these there is an app kutuki kids learning app this is an interactive app for children in which they can easily learn many aspects of maths and science through songs and stories in this there are activities too and games as well similarly there is also an app for micro blogging platform its name is ku koo ku in this we can place our opinion and interact in our mother tongue through text video or audio similarly chingari app too is getting popular among the youth there is an app ask sarkar in this you can interact through chat bot and can get right information about any government scheme that too through all the three ways text audio and video it can be a great help to you there is another app called step set go this is a fitness app and it keeps a track of how much you walked how many calories you burnt it keeps track of the data and also motivates you to stay fit i have mentioned just a few examples many more apps have also won this challenge there are many business apps and also gaming apps such as is equal to books expense zoho workplace and ftc talent search about them on the net and you will find a lot of information about these apps step forward innovate some implement some your efforts as today s small start ups will transform into big companies tomorrow and become mark of india in the world and you should not forget that the big companies which exist in the world today were also once start ups dear countrymen for our children and our students to display their optimum potential show their mettle nutrition and proper nourishment as well play a very big role the month of september will be observed as nutrition month in the entire nation nation and nutriti on are very closely inter related we have a maxim yatha annam tatha mannam which means our mental and intellectual development is directly related to the quality of our food intake experts are of the opinion that the better nutrition a child imbibes in the womb and during childhood greater is the mental development and he she remains healthy it is equally important that for children to be well nourished the mother also receives proper nourishment and nutrition merely does not only imply what you eat but also how much you eat and how often you eat this means whether you are getting essential nutrients are you getting iron calcium or not sodium or not vitamins or not all these are very important aspects of nutrition in this movement pertaining to nutrition people s participation is also very crucial it is public participation that makes it successful in our country during the past few years a lot of effort has been made in this direction especially in our villages it is being converted into a mass movement with public participation whether it is the nutrition week or the nutrition month more and more awareness is being generated through these measures schools have been integrated efforts are being made to ensure competitions for children attempts are being made to increase awareness too just like there is a class monitor in the section there should be a nutrition monitor in a similar manner and just like a report card a nutrition card should also be introduced these are some of the measures that are being initiated during the course of the nutrition month a food and nutrition quiz will also be organized on the my gov portal and there will be a meme competition as well so do participate and motivate others too friends if you have had the opportunity to visit the statue of unity of sardar vallabhbhai patel in gujarat and when it opens after covid pandemic ends you will have the opportunity to visit this spot a unique kind of nutrition park has been created there you can witness for yourselves nutrition related education along with fun and frolic friends india is a vast country with a lot of diversity in food and drink there are six different seasons in our country different regions produce diverse crops according to the respective climate therefore it is very important that according to the season of a particular region a well balanced nutrient rich diet plan should be drafted to include local food grains fruits and the vegetables cultivated there now for example millets including coarse grains like ragi finger millet and jowar sorghum these are very beneficial nutritious food an agricultural fund of india is being created it will have complete information about the crops that are grown in each district and their related nutritional value this fund can be of great use for all of you come let us inspire one and all to eat nutritious food and stay healthy during the nutrition month dear countrymen a few weeks ago while we were celebrating our independence day an interesting news caught my attention this is the news of two brave hearts of our security forces one is sophie and the other vida sophie and vida are the dogs of the indian army who have been awarded the chief of army staff commendation cards sophie and vida received this honour because they performed their duties diligently while protecting their country our armed forces and security forces have many such brave dogs who not only live for the country but also sacrifice themselves for the country such canines have played a very important role in thwarting numerous bomb blasts and terrorist conspiracies some time ago i got to know in great detail about the role of dogs in the security of the country and also got to hear many stories too one such canine named balaram sniffed out ammunition on the route of the amarnath yatra dog bhavana searched out ied in 2002 during unearthing the ied terrorists triggered an explosion and brave dog were martyred two or three years ago in bijapur chattisgarh a sniffer dog cracker of crpf also attained martyrdom in an ied blast you might have seen a very moving scene on tv a few days ago in which the beed police were giving their canine colleague rocky a final farewell with all due respect rocky had helped the police in solving over 300 cases dogs also have a significant role in disaster management and rescue missions in india ndrf the national disaster response force has specially trained dozens of dogs in the event of an earthquake building collapse these dogs are experts in searching out people trapped under debris friends i have also been told that indian breed dogs are also very good and capable among the indian breeds mudhol hound and himachali hound are of excellent pedigree rajapalayam kanni chippiparai and kombai are fabulous indian breeds they cost less to raise and are better adapted to the indian environment and surroundings now our security agencies are also inducting these indian breed dogs as part of their security squad in the recent past mudhol hound dogs have been trained and inducted in the dog squad of the army cisf and nsg kombai dogs have been included by the crpf research on the indian breed dogs is also being done by the indian council of agriculture research with the aim to make them better and more beneficial search for these breeds on the internet and know more about them the beauty and qualities of these breeds will leave you astounded the next time you think of raising a pet dog consider bringing home one of these indian breeds at a time when atmanirbhar bharat is becoming a mantra of the people how can any domain be left untouched by its influence my dear countrymen in a few days from now on september 5th we will celebrate teacher s day whenever we think of the successes we have had during the course of our lifetime we are almost always reminded of one teacher or the other the fast changing times coupled with the corona crisis are posing new challenges for our teachers i am happy that not only have our teachers accepted this challenge but also turned it into an opportunity ways to incorporate more and more technology in studying ways to imbibe newer tools ways to help students have been seamlessly embraced by our teachers they have passed it on to their students as well today throughout the country innovation is underway in some field or the other the students and teachers are collaborating to do something new i am confident that the way national education policy is bringing about a tectonic shift in the nation and that our teachers will play a significant role in disseminating its benefits to our students friends especially my teacher friends our country will celebrate the festival of the 75th year of independence in the year 2022 prior to independence our country s war of independence has had a long history during that period there wasn t any corner of the country where revolutionaries for independence did not lay down their lives or sacrificed their all for the country it is imperative that today s generation our students remain familiar with these heroes of our freedom struggle and feel the quintessence in their own district area what transpired during the freedom movement who laid down their life who was imprisoned and for how long when our students are apprised of the history of the freedom struggle viz a viz their local surroundings only then will we see the reverberations of it on the personality of the student a lot of work in this direction needs to be done and our teachers shoulder a significant responsibility for it for example the district you live in were there any events during the course of the freedom struggle in the past centuries this could also become a topic of research for our students a handwritten log for schools can be prepared if there is any place in your town associated with the freedom movement then a visit could also be planned for the students students of some schools can also resolve to write 75 poems and theatrical stories on the heroes of our freedom movement to mark the 75th year of our independence your efforts will bring to the fore stories of lakhs of unsung heroes individuals who lived and died for the country but had faded into oblivion in the 75th year of our independence it will be a fitting tribute to remember and recognise the efforts of such individuals with teachers day to be observed on september 5th i call upon all our teacher friends to start preparing and join hands to create an environment bringing everyone into its fold my dear countrymen the country is on the path of progress on which it has embarked upon and this journey will only be comfortable if each and every citizen is a stakeholder in this process and traveller in this journey for this to happen it is imperative that each citizen remains hale hearty and is part of our collective efforts to overcome corona safeguarding our health by observing do gaj ki doori mask zaroori following social distancing norms and ensuring to wear masks will help us defeat corona i urge you to follow these guidelines and i pray for your good health stay healthy and stay happy with these wishes we will meet again in the next edition of mann ki baat many many thanks namaskar this is a time for festivals

congratulated them on the amrit mahotsav on behalf of all countrymen i thank croatia and her people my dear countrymen india has been the sacred land of education and knowledge we have not confined education to bookish knowledge but have seen it as a holistic experience of life the great personalities of our country have also had a deep relationship with education while pandit madan mohan malviya ji founded the banaras hindu university mahatma gandhi played an important role in the establishment of gujarat vidyapeeth there is a very lovely place in anand gujarat vallabh vidyanagar on the insistence of sardar patel two of his associates bhai kaka and bhikha bhai established education centres for the youth there similarly gurudev rabindranath tagore established shantiniketan in west bengal maharaja gaikwad was also one of the ardent supporters of education he got many educational institutions built and inspired many personalities including dr ambedkar and shri aurobindo for higher education in the list of such great personalities there is also the name of raja mahendra pratap singh ji raja mahendra pratap singh ji had handed over his house for the establishment of a technical school he gave a lot of financial help for the construction of education centers in aligarh and mathura sometime back i also had the privilege of laying the foundation stone of a university in his name in aligarh i am happy that the same vibrant spirit of taking the light of education to the people continues in india even today do you know what is the most beautiful thing about this feeling that is this awareness about education is visible at every level in the society the example of taimmal ji living in udumalpet block of trippur district of tamil nadu is very inspiring taimmal ji does not have any land of her own for years her family is making a living by selling coconut water the financial condition may not be good but taimmal ji had left no stone unturned to educate her son and daughter her children studied in chinnaveerampatti panchayat union middle school one day in the meeting with the parents in the school it was raised that the condition of the classrooms and school should be improved the school infrastructure should be fixed taimmal ji was also in that meeting she heard everything in the same meeting the discussion again came to a halt on the paucity of money for these works after this no one could have imagined what taimmal did taimmal ji who had accumulated some capital by selling coconut water doanted one lakh rupees to the school indeed it takes a big heart a sense of service to do this taimmal ji says that in the school that is there has classes till 8th standard now when the infrastructure of the school improves classes till higher secondary education will be held this is the same sentiment i was talking about regarding education in our country i have also come to know about a similar donation by an alumnus of iit bhu jai chaudhary alumnus of bhu donated one million dollars i e about seven and a half crores to iit bhu foundation friends in our country there are many people belonging to different fields who are fulfilling their responsibility towards the society by helping others i am very happy that such efforts are being seen continuously in the field of higher education especially in our different iits there is no dearth of such inspiring examples in central universities as well to further enhance such efforts from september last year vidyanjali abhiyan has also been started in the country its objective is to improve the quality of education in schools across the country with the participation of various organizations csr and private sector vidyanjali is furthering the spirit of community participation and ownership to be constantly connected with your school college to contribute something according to your ability it is something whose fulfilment and joy can be felt only through experience my dear countrymen love for nature and compassion for every living being this is our culture as well as innate nature a glimpse of these sanskaras of ours was seen recently when a tigress left the world in pench tiger reserve of madhya pradesh people used to call this tigress collared tigress the forest department named it t 15 the death of this tigress made people so emotional as if someone of their own had left the world people performed her last rites bid her farewell with full respect and affection you must have also seen these pictures on social media this love of indians for nature and living beings was greatly appreciated the world over the collared tigress gave birth to 29 cubs in her lifetime and raised 25 of them to maturity we also celebrated this life of t 15 and when she left the world we also gave her a heartfelt farewell this is the specialty of the people of india we make a relationship of love with every conscious being we also got to see a similar sight this time in the republic day parade as well in this parade the charger mount of the president s bodyguard virat took part in his last parade horse virat came to rashtrapati bhavan in 2003 and used to lead the parade every time on republic day as commandant charger even when a foreign head of state was welcomed in rashtrapati bhavan virat used to play this role this year on army day horse virat was also given coas commendation card by the army chief in view of virat s immense services after his retirement he was given farewell in an equally grand manner my dear countrymen when there is a sincere effort work is done with a noble intention results also follow a great example of this has emerged from assam as soon as the name of assam is taken the thought of tea plantation and many national parks come to mind along with this the picture of one horned rhinoceros i e one horn rhino also emerges in our mind you all know that the one horned rhinoceros has always been a part of assamese culture this song of bharat ratna bhupen hazarika ji will resonate in every ear friends the meaning of this song is very relevant this song says the lush green surroundings of kaziranga the abode of elephants and tigers the earth watches one horned rhinoceros and listens to the melodious chirping of birds the images of the rhinoceros are also seen in the moonga and eri dresses woven on the world famous handlooms of assam the rhinoceros which has such great glory in the culture of assam also had to face difficulties in 2013 37 and in 2014 32 rhinos were killed by poachers to tackle this challenge a huge campaign against the poaching of rhinoceros was launched in the last seven years with the special efforts of the assam government on the 22nd of september last year on the occasion of world rhino day more than 2400 horns seized from smugglers were burnt this was a stern message to the poachers the result of such efforts is that now there is a steady decrease in the hunting of rhinos in assam where 37 rhinos were killed in 2013 2 killings in 2020 and only 1 in 2021 have come to the fore i appreciate the resolve of the people of assam to save the rhinoceros friends the diverse colours and spiritual strength of indian culture have always attracted people from all over the world if i tell you that indian culture is very popular in america canada dubai singapore western europe and japan you will find this very common you will not be surprised but if i say that indian culture has a big attraction in latin america and south america too you will definitely think once whether it is a matter of promoting khadi in mexico or an attempt to popularize indian traditions in brazil we have discussed these topics earlier in mann ki baat today i will tell you about the

more than 40 000 members and about 30 branches in argentina and other latin american countries hastinapur foundation has also published more than 100 vedic and philosophical texts in spanish language her ashram is also very enchanting twelve temples have been built in the ashram in which there are idols of many gods and goddesses there is also a temple at the center of all this which has been

natural inclination to be enchanted by the delights of the rainy season animals birds flora nature in its entirety is filled with the joys of the season but sometimes when the rain unleashes full force of its fury we come to realise the extent of the destructive might of water mother nature gives us life and nurtures us but at times natural catastrophes such as floods and earthquakes wreak havoc on a massive scale climate change altered weather cycles and transformations in the environment are also having a big negative impact recently in certain parts of india particularly assam north east gujarat rajasthan and some areas of bengal have had to bear the brunt of natural disasters caused by excessive rains flood affected areas are being closely monitored relief efforts have been undertaken on an extensive cale wherever possible my colleagues in the council of ministers are also personally visiting affected areas the state governments too are making maximum possible efforts on their part to provide relief to the flood affected people social organisations cultural organizations and common citizens charged with the spirit of service are also making their utmost efforts to help the affected people in this situation the government of india army personnel air force personnel ndrf personnel paramilitary forces everybody does his or her best in providing succour to the disaster stricken people life goes completely topsy turvy as a result of the floods crops livestock infrastructure roads electricity communication links everything gets affected in particular our farmer brethren have to bear a lot of losses because of the damage to their crops and fields therefore we have formulated a scheme for the insurance companies especially crop insurance companies to make them more proactive to ensure quick settlements of claims for farmers a 24 7 control room helpline number 1078 is functioning continuously to deal with the flood situation people are also voicing their difficulties before the monsoons the entire government machinery was brought into a state of preparedness through mock drills undertaken at most of the places ndrf teams were deployed aapada mitra or friends during disaster were identified at various places and these were then trained in the do s and don ts volunteers were enlisted and a people s organisation set up to work in this situation weather forecasts are available these days and the concerned technology has become so advanced these days and space science also plays a very big role that these weather forecasts turn out to be mostly accurate now we should also gradually make it our nature to set our work patterns according to the weather predictions which could safeguard us against losses whenever i prepare myself for mann ki baat i find that the citizens of our country prepare themselves even more this time around there have been innumerable letters and phone calls in regard to gst people are still expressing their happiness about gst and are also eager to know more about it i would like you to hear one such phone call namaskar pradhan mantri ji this is neetu garg from gurgaon i heard your speech on the chartered accountants day and was deeply impressed in the same manner goods and services tax gst was launched on this very day last month could you please elaborate whether its results after one month are matching the expectations of the government i would like to hear your views on this thank you it has been one month since gst was implemented and its benefits can be seen already i feel very happy and satisfied when a poor person writes to say how because of gst prices of various items essential for him have come down and commodities have become cheaper when a person from the north east someone living in the remote areas in the hills or forests writes a letter to communicate that in the beginning he used to be apprehensive about gst wondering what it was all about but now that he has begun to understand it he feels that things have become much easier than before doing business has become so much easier and most important of all the trust of customers for the traders is increasing i have been observing how gst has impacted the transport and logistics sector how the movement of trucks has increased the time required to cover distances has come down drastically highways have become clutter free pollution levels have come down with the increased speeds of the trucks goods are also being transported much faster this indeed is a convenience but at the same time it is also bolstering the economic progress earlier because of the multiple tax structures maximum resources of the transport and logistics sector were expended in maintaining paperwork and that also led to the need for construction of new warehouses in each state i call gst good and simple tax indeed it has produced a big positive effect on our economy in a very short time span the speed at which the smooth transition has taken place along with rapid migration and new registrations has instilled a new sense of confidence in the entire country and some day the pundits of economics pundits of management and pundits of technology will certainly undertake researches and write about india s gst experiment as a model for the world it will become a case study for universities across the world the implementation and furtherance of such a phenomenal change on such a monumental scale with the involvement of so many tens of millions of people in such a vast country is in itself a pinnacle of success the world will definitely make a study of it and this implementation has had all the states participating in it and sharing the responsibility all decisions have been taken unanimously by the states and the centre together and as a result one overriding priority for every government has been to ensure that there is no burden on the plate of the poor on account of gst and using the gst app all information is available on your mobile phone as to how much the price of an item was earlier and how much will it be now in the new situation the lofty dream of one nation one tax has finally been fulfilled in the matter of gst i have seen how everyone right from the government functionaries at the tehsil level to the officers in the top echelons of government of india have toiled tirelessly with great dedication the manner in which the friendly environment was created between the government and traders between the government and consumers played a very significant role in enhancing mutual trust i extend my heartiest felicitations to each and every ministry every department and all employees of the central and state governments involved with this process gst is a fine example of the collective strength of the people of india this is a historic achievement and this is not just a tax reform it is a new economic order that will strengthen a new culture of honesty in a way it is also a campaign for social reformation i would like to once again express my deep gratitude to the millions of my countrymen who have contributed to the successful achievement of this great feat with such felicity my dear countrymen the month of august is the month of revolution we have been hearing this as a natural fact right from our childhood and the reason is the non cooperation movement was launched on the 1st of august 1920 the quit india movement which is also known as agast kranti began on the 9th of august 1942 and on 15thaugust 1947 india became independent in a way there are many events in the month of august that are closely associated with the history of our freedom movement this year we are going to observe the 75th anniversary of the quit india movement but very few people know the fact that the slogan quit india was coined by dr yusuf meher ali our young generation must know what had happened on the 9th of august 1942 from 1857 to 1942 the people of india with their ardent desire for freedom came together fought together and suffered hardships these pages of history are an inspiration to us for building a glorious india the heroes of our freedom struggle with their single minded devotion did a tapasya endured hardships made great sacrifices and even laid down their lives what greater inspiration could there be the quit india movement was an important milestone in the indian freedom movement it was this movement that had made the entire nation determined to attain freedom from the british rule this was the time when the people of india in every part of the country be it a village or city the educated or illiterate the rich or poor everyone came together shoulder to shoulder and became a part of the quit india movement people s anger was at its peak millions of indians responded to mahatma gandhi s clarion call and the mantra of do or die they flung themselves into the struggle millions of the youth of the country renounced their studies gave up their books they set out on the march to the sound of the bugle for freedom mahatma gandhi gave a call for the quit india movement on 9th august but each and every prominent leader had been imprisoned by the british government and it was during this time that the second generation of leadership comprising great men like dr lohia jaiprakash narain played a leading and pivotal role in the non cooperation movement of 1920 and the quit india movement of 1942 two different personas of mahatma gandhi can be seen the whole scenario of the quit india movement was different and in 1942 things rose to such a point there was such a heightened sense of intensity that a mahapurush like mahatma gandhi gave the mantra of do or die the reason for this entire success was the people s support people s resolve and people s struggle the entire country had come together as one to fight for the cause and i sometimes think that if we link the pages of history it is seen that the first war of independence took place in 1857 the freedom struggle which began in 1857 continued to be manifested in one or the other corner of the country till 1942 this long time period ignited the intense longing for freedom in the hearts of the people each one became committed to do something the determination did not diminish with each passing generation new people kept coming forward each time in place of those who departed and the country kept on every moment endeavouring tirelessly to uproot the british rule this perseverance this struggle from 1857 to 1942 created a situation which reached its climax in 1942 the clarion call of quit india was such that within five years in 1947 the british were compelled to leave india 1857 to 1942 the yearning for freedom had reached the grassroots had reached everybody and 1942 to 1947 these decisive five years became integral for the masses to successfully attain through resolve freedom for the country these five years were indeed decisive i would now like to connect you with its mathematical manifestation we became free in 1947 this is 2017 it has been almost 70 years governments have come and gone systems have been made changed nurtured and expanded everyone has tried to rid the country of its problems in one s own way there have been efforts towards increasing employment poverty alleviation and development these efforts were also driven with hard work in their different ways there have been successes expectations have also risen the way the years from 1942 to 1947 were the decisive years for attainment through resolve i can see that 2017 to 2022 presents itself as a new time segment of five years for attainment through resolve we should celebrate 15th august 2017 as the sankalp parva or the day of resolve and in 2022 marking 75 years of freedom we will certainly transform that resolve into siddhi or attainment if 1 25 billion indians commemorate agast kranti day of 9th august and each person resolves on 15th august that he or she will do for the country this much as an individual as a citizen this much as a family this much as a society this much as a village this much as a city this much as a government department and this much as the government let there be millions and millions of resolves let there be strivings for the realisation of these millions and millions of resolves just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 were decisive for the country s independence these five years from 2017 to 2022 can and must play a decisive role for the future of india five years from now we will celebrate 75 years of india s independence therefore we must take a firm resolve today we must make 2017 our year of resolve in this month of august we have to come together and resolve filth quit india poverty quit india

blogs scripts novel ideas to put forward all these transform this campaign into a peoples movement a quit india quiz is also being launched for my young friends on narendramodiapp this quiz is an attempt to familiarise the youth with india s glorious history and the heroes of the freedom movement it is my belief that you will surely publicise and spread awareness about this quiz my dear countrymen on august 15 as the nation s pradhan sewak i get an opportunity to communicate with the country from the ramparts of the red fort i am merely an instrument it is not one single person who makes that address but it is the collective voice of 1 25 billion of my countrymen that resounds from the red fort i try to give words to their dreams and i am glad that for the past 3 years i get suggestions from every corner of the country for august 15 as to what i should speak on the 15th august and which issues should i include in my address on the occasion this time too i invite you to share your thoughts either on mygov or on narendramodiapp i read these myself and shall try to express them in whatever time i have with me on 15th august for the previous three 15th august speeches one consistent complaint has been that my speeches tend to be a little lengthy i have planned to keep my speech short this time not more than 40 45 50 minutes i have tried to draw these rules for myself but i don t know whether i ll be able to stick to them but i do intend to try this time to shorten my speech let s see whether i succeed or not my countrymen i would like to say one more thing to you india s economy has in itself an element of social economics and we should never underestimate its value our festivals our celebrations are not merely occasions of joy and merriment our festivals are in themselves campaigns of social reform too and each of our festivals are directly linked with the financial conditions of the poorest of the poor rakshabandhan janmashtami ganesh utsav chauth chandra anant chaturdashi durga pooja diwali these will be observed one after the other and this is also the time when the poor get an opportunity to earn an income and of course this adds a spontaneous joy to the festivities festivals lend a sweetness to our relationships bring a warmth of togetherness in the family and foster brotherhood in society they connect the individual with society it is a natural journey from the self to the collective and the i gets an opportunity to transform into a we as far as the economy is concerned hundreds of families start making rakhis in small household units many months before the festival of rakhi a variety of rakhis are made in a whole range of materials from khadi to silken threads people prefer homemade rakhis these days rakhi makers and their sellers sweets shops vendors the professions of hundreds thousands flourish on the occasion of a festival the households of our poor brethren and their families are dependent in a way on these activities when we light a diya an earthen lamp on deepawali it is not merely a festival of lights a festival that illuminates the entire house it is directly connected with those poor families who make small diyas or earthen lamps today as i speak about festivals and how they are linked to the economy of the poor i want to touch upon the subject of environment as well i have observed and sometimes think that the citizens of our country are more aware and active than me for the last one month environmentally conscious citizens have constantly written letters to me and they have requested that i talk about eco friendly ganesha idols well in time for people to plan for clay ganesha idols during the festival of ganesh chaturthi firstly i am most grateful to such conscientious citizens they have urged me to speak on this subject well before the festival of ganesh chaturthi this time around there is a special significance to the observance of community ganesh festival as a public celebration lokmanya tilak ji started this great tradition and this year marks the 125th anniversary of community ganesh festival 125 years and 1 25 billion countrymen lokmanya tilak ji started the sarvjanik ganeshotsav with the basic aim to inculcate the spirit of unity enhance awareness in society and promote the culture of togetherness so this year we should again during the ganesh festival organise essay competitions have open discussions and remember the contributions of lokmanya tilak and we must think anew ways to steer community ganesh festivals in consonance with the sentiments of tilak ji how we must lend strength to that spirit and at the same time resolve to use eco friendly clay ganesha idols to protect the environment and this time i have spoken about it well in time i am sure that all of you will join me this will surely benefit our poor artisans and artists and provide employment to those who make idols the poor will be able to earn a living and feed themselves come let us link our festivities with the economic welfare of the poor let the joys of our festivals connect with the households of the underprivileged bringing monetary happiness to the have nots this should be the endeavor of all of us i extend my best wishes to all my countrymen for the various upcoming festivals and celebrations my dear countrymen we are continually seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to the country in all the fields be it education economic activities social spheres or in sports they are scaling new heights we as a nation take great pride in our daughters recently our daughters performed brilliantly in the women s cricket world cup this week i had the opportunity to meet our daughters the members of our women s cricket team i felt happy talking to them but i had a feeling that they felt burdened by the fact that they could not win the world cup this stress this tension was evident on their faces also so while speaking to these daughters i put forth a different viewpoint before them i said look this is the age of the media so expectations get hyped up to such an extent that if corresponding success is not achieved these turn into despair and even resentment we have seen during many such events where if the indian players fail the anger of the country is vented towards the players some people cross all limits of decency and say and write things that inflict pain and hurt but it happened for the first time that when our daughters did not succeed in winning the world cup the hundred and twenty five million people took this defeat on their own shoulders never letting the burden weigh down these daughters of ours not only this they lauded them and showered them with high praise for their brilliant performance i view this as a healthy and pleasant change and i told these daughters that only they were blessed with such good fortune and hence they should banish any thought of not having been successful you may not have won the final match but you have won the hearts of 1 25 billion indians truly our young generation especially the daughters of our country are doing so much to bring glory to the nation i once again extend my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to the young generation of our country especially our daughters my dear countrymen i remind you once again of agast kranti of 9th august i remind you once again of 15th august and i am reminding you once again of 2022 75 years of india s independence every countryman should make a resolve every countryman should prepare a 5 year roadmap to realise that resolve all of us have to take our nation to newer heights we must strive tirelessly to do so come let s march together as we do our bit the destiny the future of the country shall be brighter let us move ahead with this belief lots and lots of good wishes to you all thank you yes monsoon is enjoyable but this season also leads to floods we are doing everything to help in relief rehabilitation mannkibaat a 24x7 control room helpline number 1078 is functioning continuously to deal with the flood situation pm narendramodi mannkibaat like always i seek ideas and suggestions from people this time i have got lot of calls and letters on gst pm mannkibaat it has been one month since gst was implemented and its benefits can be seen already pm narendramodi i feel very happy when a poor person writes to say how because of gst prices of various items essential for him have come down pm gst has transformed the economy mannkibaat successful rollout of gst is a case study it is also an example of cooperative federalism all decisions taken by both centre states gst is more than just a tax reform it ushers in a new culture mannkibaat the month of august has seen historic movements in india mannkibaat starting from 1857 we saw so many movements for india s freedom mannkibaat we remember mahatma gandhi for his leadership during quit india we remember leaders like lok nayak jp dr lohia who took part in it in 1920 and 1942 we saw two different gandhian movements what was common was the widespread support for mahatma gandhi our clarion call in 2017 mannkibaat today we do not have to die for the nation we have to live for our nation and take it to new heights of progress mannkibaat a pledge for a new india mannkibaat when i am speaking on 15th august from the ramparts of the red fort i am merely the medium it is the people whose voice is resonating our festivals also bring economic opportunities for the poor mannkibaat festivals light the lamp of prosperity in the homes of the poor mannkibaat in this day and age expectations are raised so much and then if our team can t win some people don t even respect basic decencies pm but the way india supported the women s cricket team shows a shift i am happy how india took pride in the team s accomplishment pm,gst is a fine example of the collective strength of the people of india i would like to express my deep gratitude to the millions of my countrymen who have contributed to the successful achievement of this great feat

15th.",30-jul-2023 pm s address in the 103rd episode of mann ki baat my dear countrymen namaskar a warm welcome to all of you in mann ki baat the month of july means the month of monsoon the month of rain the past few days have been full of anxiety and hardships on account of natural calamities owing to flooding in many rivers including the yamuna people in many areas have had to suffer landslides have also occurred in hilly areas meanwhile in the western part of the country biparjoy cyclone also hit the areas of gujarat some time ago but friends in the midst of these calamities all of us countrymen have once again brought to the fore the power of collective effort the local people our ndrf jawans those from the local administration have worked day and night to combat such calamities our capabilities and resources play a big role in dealing with any disaster but at the same time our sensitivity and the spirit of hand holding is equally important this spirit of sarvajan hitaaya is the hallmark of india as well as the strength of india friends this phase of rain is equally important for tree plantation and water conservation more than 60 thousand amrit sarovars built during the azaadi ka amrit mahotsav are increasingly radiating their glow presently the work of building more than 50 thousand amrit sarovars is going on our countrymen are making novel efforts for water conservation with full awareness and responsibility you might remember sometime ago i had gone to shahdol m p there i met tribal brothers and sisters of pakaria village at the same time i had a discussion with them to save nature and water now i have come to know that the tribal brothers and sisters of pakaria village have already started working on this here with the help of the administration people have converted about a hundred wells into water recharge systems rain water now flows into these wells and from the wells the water enters the ground this will gradually improve the ground water level in the area now all the villagers have set a target of using about 800 wells in the entire area for recharging one such encouraging news has come in from u p a few days ago in uttar pradesh a record of planting 30 crore trees in a single day has been made this campaign was started by the state government it was completed by the people there such efforts are great examples of public participation as well as public awareness i would like all of us to be a part of these efforts to plant trees and save water my dear countrymen at present the holy month of saawan is going on along with worshiping sadashiv mahadev sawan is associated with greenery and joy that s why sawan has been very important from the spiritual as well as cultural point of view the swings of sawan the mehendi of sawan the festivities of sawan that is sawan itself means joy and enthusiasm friends there is yet another facet to this faith and these traditions of ours these festivals and traditions of ours make us dynamic many devotees undertake the kanwar yatra to worship shiva in sawan these days numerous devotees are reaching the 12 jyotirlingas on account of sawan you would also be happy to know that the number of people reaching banaras is also breaking records now more than 10 crore tourists are reaching kashi every year the number of devotees visiting pilgrimages like ayodhya mathura ujjain is also increasing rapidly due to this lakhs of poor are getting employment their livelihood is being taken care of all this is the result of our collective cultural awakening now for darshan people from all over the world are coming to our pilgrimage sites i have come to know about two such american friends who had come here from california to perform the amarnath yatra these foreign guests had heard somewhere about the experiences of swami vivekananda related to the amarnath yatra they got so inspired that they themselves came for the amarnath yatra they consider it as the blessings of lord bholenath this is the specialty of india that she accepts everyone gives something or the other to everyone similarly there is a woman of french origin charlotte chopin recently when i had gone to france i had met her charlotte chopin is a yoga practitioner yoga teacher and she is more than a 100 years old she has crossed a century she has been practicing yoga for the last 40 years she gives credit for her health and this age of 100 years only to yoga she has become a prominent face of india s science of yoga and its strength in the world everyone should learn from her let us not only embrace our heritage but also present it responsibly to the world and i am happy that one such effort is going on in ujjain these days here 18 painters from all over the country are making attractive picture story books based on the puranas these paintings will be made in many distinctive styles such as the bundi style nathdwara style pahari style and apabhramsh style these will be displayed in ujjain s triveni museum after some time when you visit ujjain you will be able to see another divine site along with mahakal mahalok friends while referring to these paintings being made in ujjain i am reminded of another unique painting this painting had been made by prabhat singh modbhai barhat an artist from rajkot this painting was based on an incident in the life of chhatrapati veer shivaji maharaj artist prabhat bhai had depicted that chhatrapati shivaji maharaj was going to visit his kuldevi tulja mata after the coronation and what the atmosphere there at that time was to keep our traditions our heritage alive we have to save it live it teach it to the next generation i am happy that today many efforts are being made in this direction my dear countrymen many a time when we hear words like ecology flora fauna bio diversity some people think that these are specialized subjects subjects related to experts but it is not so if we really love nature we can do a lot even with our small efforts suresh raghavan ji is a friend from vadavalli in tamil nadu raghavan ji is fond of painting you know painting is a work related to art and canvas but raghavan ji decided that he would preserve the information about plants and animals through his paintings he documents the information related to them by making paintings of varied flora and fauna till now he has made paintings of dozens of such birds animals orchids which are on the verge of extinction this example of serving nature through art is really amazing my dear countrymen today i want to tell you one more interesting thing a few days ago an awesome craze appeared on social media america has returned to us more than a hundred rare and ancient artefacts after this news came to the fore there was a lot of discussion on social media about these artefacts the youth displayed a sense of pride in their heritage these artefacts returned to india are 2500 to 250 years old you will also be happy to know that these rare items are related to different regions of the country these have been made using terracotta stone metal and wood some of these are such that they will fill you with wonder if you have a look at them you will be left mesmerised you will also get to see a beautiful sandstone sculpture of the 11th century among these this is an artwork of an apsara dancing which belongs to madhya pradesh many idols of the chola era are also part of these the idols of devi and lord murugan date back to the 12th century and are associated with the rich culture of tamil nadu nearly a thousand year old bronze statue of lord ganesha has also been returned to india an idol of uma maheshwara in lalitasan is said to be of the 11th century in which both of them are seated on nandi two stone idols of jain tirthankaras have also come back to india two idols of bhagwan surya dev will also enthrall you one of these is made of sandstone among the items returned is a panel made of wood which brings to the fore the story of the churning of the ocean this panel of 16th 17th century is associated with south india friends i have mentioned just a few names here whereas if you see this list is very long i would like to thank the american government who have returned this valuable heritage of ours even when i visited america in 2016 and 2021 many artefacts were returned to india i am sure that with such efforts awareness will increase across the country to stop the theft of our cultural heritage this will further deepen the attachment of the countrymen with our rich heritage my dear countrymen the letters written by some mothers and sisters of devbhoomi uttarakhand to me are touchingly heart warming they have given many blessings to their son their brother they have written that they had never imagined that our erstwhile cultural heritage bhojpatra could become a means of their livelihood you must be wondering what the entire matter is friends this letter has been written to me by the women of niti mana valley in chamoli district these are the women who had presented me a unique artwork on bhojpatra in october last year i was also overwhelmed on receiving this gift after all since ancient times our scriptures and books have been preserved on these bhojpatras mahabharata was also written on the bhojpatra today these women of devbhoomi are making very beautiful artefacts and souvenirs from the bhojpatra during my visit to mana village i had appreciated his unique effort i had appealed to the tourists coming to devbhoomi to buy as many local products as possible during their visit it has had a great impact there today the products of bhojpatra are very much liked by the pilgrims coming here and are also buying it at good prices this ancient heritage of bhojpatra is filling new hues of happiness in the lives of the women of uttarakhand i am also happy to know that the state government is also imparting training to women to make novel products from bhojpatra the state government has also started a campaign to preserve the rare species of bhojpatra the areas which were once considered as the last point of the land are now being developed considering them as the first villages of the country along with preserving our tradition and culture this effort is also becoming a means of economic progress my dear countrymen i have also received a large number of such letters this time in man ki baat that give a lot of satisfaction to the mind these letters have been written by those muslim women who have recently come from haj pilgrimage this journey of theirs is very special in many ways these are the women who have performed hajj without any male companion or mehram and the number is not fifty or hundred but more than four thousand this is a huge transformation earlier muslim women were not allowed to perform hajj without mehram through mann ki baat i also express my heartfelt gratitude to the government of saudi arabia women coordinators were specially appointed for women going on haj without mehram friends the changes that have been made in the haj policy in the last few years are being highly appreciated our muslim mothers and sisters have written a lot to me about this now more and more people are getting the chance to go for haj the blessing given by the people who have returned from haj pilgrimage especially our mothers and sisters through their letters is very inspiring in itself my dear countrymen whether be the musical nights in jammu kashmir bike rallies at high altitudes local clubs in chandigarh and the many sports groups in punjab it sounds like we are talking about entertainment and adventure but it s something different this event is also related to a common cause and this common cause is the awareness campaign against drugs to save the youth of jammu and kashmir from drugs many innovative efforts have been visible programs like musical night bike rallies are happening there to spread this message in chandigarh local clubs have been linked with it they call these vada clubs vada means victory against drug abuse many sports groups have also been formed in punjab which are running awareness campaigns to focus on fitness and get rid of drug addiction the increasing participation of youth in the campaign against drug abuse is very encouraging these efforts lend a lot of strength to the campaign against drugs in india if we want to save the future generations of the country we have to keep them away from drugs with this thought nashamukt bharat abhiyan was launched on the 15 august 2020 more than 11 crore people have been connected with this campaign two weeks ago india has taken a huge action against drugs after seizing about 1 5 lakh kg consignment of drugs it has been destroyed india has also created a unique record of destroying 10 lakh kg of drugs the cost of these drugs was more than rs 12 000 crore i would like to appreciate all those who are contributing in this noble campaign of de addiction drug addiction becomes a big problem not only for the family but for the whole society in such a situation for this danger to end forever it is necessary that we all move forward in this direction in unison my dear countrymen while talking about drugs and the young generation i would also like to tell you about an inspiring journey from madhya pradesh this is the inspiring journey of mini brazil you must be thinking that from where mini brazil came in madhya pradesh well that is the twist in mp bicharpur is a village in shahdol bicharpur is called mini brazil mini brazil since today this village has become a stronghold of the rising stars of football when i had gone to shahdol a few weeks ago i met many such football players there i felt that our countrymen and especially our young friends must know about this friends the journey of bichharpur village to become mini brazil commenced two and a half decades ago during that time bicharpur village was infamous for illicit liquor it was in the grip of intoxication the biggest brunt of this kind of environment was being borne by the youth here raees ahmed a former national player and coach recognized the talent of these youngsters raees ji did not have many resources but he started teaching football to the youth with full dedication within a few years football became so popular that bicharpur village itself was identified with football now a program called football kranti is also going on here under this program youth are connected with this game and they are given training this program has been so successful that more than 40 national and state level players have emerged from bicharpur this football revolution is now slowly spreading in the entire region more than 1200 football clubs have been formed in shahdol and its surrounding areas a large number of players are emerging from here who are playing at the national level today many noted former football players and coaches are imparting training to the youth here just imagine a tribal area which was known for illicit liquor infamous for drug addiction has now become the football nursery of the country that s why it is said where there is a will there is a way there is no dearth of talent in our country there is certainly a need to find and nurture them subsequently these youth also bring laurels to the country and lend direction to the development of the country as well my dear countrymen on the occasion of completion of 75 years of independence all of us are celebrating amrit mahotsav with full enthusiasm about two lakh programs have been organized in the country during the amrit mahotsav these programs were adorned with a spectrum of colours were full of diversity the beauty of these events

rather long pause we are resuming once again our series of touching upon matters close to people and their hearts in fact subjects close to every person s heart i am once again amidst you with our mann ki baat the rigours of elections called for hectic preoccupation but the one thing that was missing was the sheer joy of mann ki baat for me it was like experiencing a kind of void it used to be a chat in a genial atmosphere amidst the warmth of one s own family of 130 crore countrymen we would listen we would re iterate at times our expressions would turn into an inspiration for someone close to us you can imagine how this period must have made one feel sunday the last sunday at 11 o clock even i used to be uneasy with a nagging feeling of a kind of emptiness you too felt the same didn t you i am sure you did perhaps this was not a lifeless programme it was full of liveliness warmth and fondness and that is why for me the intervening period was very difficult to bear i used to miss something every moment when i express myself through mann ki baat the one speaking is me the words are mine the voice is mine but the story is yours the purusharth pertaining to your pursuits and goals is yours the parakram the achievement is yours i just used my words and my voice and that is why i was not missing the programme i was missing you i was undergoing a bout of emptiness there came a moment when i felt the need to reach out to you immediately after the elections concluded then i thought no the established sunday sequence should be maintained but this sunday has made one wait endlessly anyway finally the opportunity has dawned in a family like atmosphere these plain simple reflections become the reason for change in life in society begetting a new spirit in a way fortifying the spirit of new india let us wish this endeavour embarks upon its onward journey over the last few months many messages have poured in with people stating that they have been missing mann ki baat when i read them when i hear them it gives me joy it s a warm feeling of kinship there are times when i feel that this is my journey from the self to the unabridged whole my journey from i to we for me this nonvocal conversation with you was a part of my feelings during my spiritual journey amidst hectic election engagements many people asked me a flurry of questions on why i had gone up to kedarnath you have every right i can understand your curiosity and i too feel that my sentiments reach you but today i think if i change the course of the conversation that way the entire complexion of mann ki baat will change amidst the rigours of the election speculations on victory or defeat before the polling was yet to start i undertook the journey most people have derived political conclusions out of that for me it was an opportunity to meet myself in a way i undertook the journey to meet my inner self i shall not reveal other things today but i certainly want to tell you that perhaps in that solitary cave i got an opportunity to fill up the vacuum caused due to the long pause that mann ki baat had to go through the rest is your inquisitiveness i think someday i ll talk about that too when i can t say but i ll do it for sure you have every right as far as i am concerned the way people have expressed their wish to know about kedar i feel a similar effort on your part to lay emphasis on positive things which i get to know through your expressions the letters which steadily pour in for mann ki baat the inputs that are received are entirely different from routine government matters one way a letter from you can act as a source of inspiration for me on the other it may turn out to be a source of energy for me there are times when some of your words act as a catalyst in sharpening my thought process people bring to the fore challenges facing the country and society they also come out with solutions for the same i have seen for myself that in their letters people go to great lengths in describing their problems it is fascinating to see that in the same breath they express directly or indirectly a relevant solution or two one suggestion or the other or even an idea if someone refers to sanitation and cleanliness he or she invariably voices angst against filth dirt but on the same page appreciates efforts being under way to ensure cleanliness when somebody talks about the environment one can easily sense his or her crucial concerns on the matter at the same time experiments that the person has attempted or seen also come to the surface with vivid descriptions of new ideas on the issue this means i can closely get a fair idea of your point in terms of extrapolating a solution to a certain problem on a society wide scale mann ki baat is like a mirror to the country our society it conveys to us that there is no dearth of inner fortitude strength talent within our countrymen the need of the hour is to synergise those strengths and talents to provide opportunities to implement them mann ki baat also tells us that a 130 crore countrymen wish to be strongly and actively a part of the nation s progress i receive a lot of letters and phone calls in mann ki baat but the element of complaint is negligible and i would like to tell you that in the last five years i have not come across a single instance where somebody has asked for something for personal gain just imagine a person writing to the prime minister of the country but seeking nothing for one s own self it is a reflection on the lofty collective demeanour of crores of people in the country when i analyse this you can visualise how heartening it must be for me what a source of energy it is for me you possibly don t know that you are the ones who make me walk who make me run and keep me full of life and zest this is the very bond that i used to miss my heart is filled to the brim with joy today when it was about to end i had stated that we would meet once again after 3 or 4 months people assigned a political hue to it saying hey modi ji is so full of confidence he is certain the confidence was not modi s this trust was the trust of your foundation you were the ones who transformed yourself into a pillar of trust and that is why in the last episode of mann ki baat then i effortlessly said that i would be back after a few months actually speaking i have not returned you brought me back you positioned me here and gave me the opportunity to speak once again with this sentiment come let s take mann ki baat forward when emergency was imposed on the country resistance against it was not limited to the political arena or politicians the movement was not curtailed to the confines of prison cells there was an outrage in the conscience of one and all the collective torment on the loss of democracy was evident day and night when one gets to eat food on time one doesn t realize what hunger pangs are similarly in day to day life it is difficult to savour the joy of democratic rights unless they are snatched away during emergency every citizen of the country had started getting the feeling that something that belonged to him had been snatched away if what was snatched had never been enjoyed by that person ever it had to eventually precipitate into a painful inner agony and it was not just on account of the fact that the constitution of india has made certain provisions that enabled democracy to blossom of course in order to ensure smooth conduct of the social order a constitution is required laws rules are necessary rights and duties should be part of due discourse but india can proudly proclaim that for us beyond laws rules democracy is embedded in our sanskar democracy is our culture democracy is our heritage we grew up nurturing ourselves on the fruits of that very heritage and that is why the lack of it can be felt deeply by our countrymen which is what we underwent during emergency and precisely for that the country sacrificed one full election not for her own sake but for the sake of protecting democracy perhaps nowhere else in the world had citizens voted without bothering about other rights requirements just for the sake of saving democracy and the country had witnessed one such election in 77 just recently our country celebrated a mega festival of democracy a mammoth election campaign from the rich to the poor all were happily eager in this festival to decide the fate of their country when something is in close proximity of us we tend to underestimate its importance we ignore even amazing facts about it we have been blessed with a democracy so invaluable yet we take it for granted so easily but we must keep reminding ourselves that our democracy is gloriously great it flows in our veins through centuries of sadhana dedicated practice through the sanskar attributes that have been passed on from generations over through a collective largeness of the heart in the 2019 loksabha election india saw over 61 crore voters exercising their franchise yes 61 crores we can think of this figure as one ordinary but if i place it in a global perspective if you exclude china the number of people who voted in india exceeds the population of any other country in the world the number of people who voted in the 2019 lok sabha election is more than the entire population of america close to double the figure the total number of voters in india exceeds the entire population of europe this stands for the sheer size spread of our democracy the 2019 lok sabha election in history by far was the largest democratic election ever held in the world you can imagine the kind of resources and manpower that was required for such a mammoth exercise lakhs of teachers officers staff strived day night to make it possible in order to successfully conclude this mahayagya on the one hand whereas close to three lakh paramilitary personnel discharged their duty on the other 20 lakh police personnel of various states too persevered with due diligence it is on account of these people that this time voting took place on a larger scale compared to the previous election for the voting there were around 10 lakh polling stations more than 40 lakh evm machines over 17 lakh vvpat machines you can imagine the gargantuan task all this was done just to ensure that no voter was deprived of his or her voting rights in a remote area of arunachal pradesh just for a lone woman voter a polling station was created you will be amazed to know that it took a journey of two days for personnel of the election commission just to reach there this is honour to democracy at its best the world s highest located polling station too is in india at an altitude of 15 000 feet it is located in the lahaulspiti region of himachal pradesh besides this there is another fact pertaining to these elections that swells our hearts with pride perhaps this is the first time ever that women have enthusiastically voted as much as men did this time the ratio of men women who voted was almost the same another encouraging fact is that today there are a record 78 women members of parliament i congratulate the election commission and every person connected with the electioneering process and salute the aware voters of india my dear countrymen you may often have heard me say no bouquet just a book i had urged all to choose books over flowers in welcome or felicitation ceremonies since then people have been offering books at many a place just recently someone gave me a book entitled premchand ki lokapriyakahaniyan popular short stories by premchand it was a great feeling of course i couldn t get much time but during my travelling i got an opportunity to read some of his short stories once again images of the stark social realities that premchand has portrayed in his stories vividly start forming in one s mind when you read them each every element of his writings comes alive his stories are expressions of human emotions through simple lucid language they have touched my heart his stories embody the collective psyche the cumulative being of the country of the land while reading one of his stories nashaa i couldn t help but notice the scourge of economic disparity plaguing society i was reminded of my younger days how debates on this subject would carry on through entire nights the moral of this story featuring the landholder s son eeshwari and beer from a poor family is that if you are not careful enough you will never know when the bane of bad company engulfs you the other story that touched the core of my heart was eidgah the sensitivity of a young lad his unsullied love for his grandmother such maturity at that early age when 4 5 years old hamid comes back to his grandma with a pair of tongs indeed it stirs human emotions to their supreme pinnacle the concluding line of this story makes one very emotional since it holds a vital truth about life young hamid played the role of aged hamid aged ameena had turned into child ameena another such poignant story is poos ki raat in this story the living depiction of the paradoxes in a poor farmer s life is seen halku the farmer is happy even after his crops are destroyed by frost because now he will not be forced to sleep in his fields in the cold winter though these stories were written about a century ago but remain relevant all the same even today after reading these stories i felt myself to be empathetic now that we are conversing about reading then in some extension of media i had read about the akshara library in kerala you will be surprised to learn that this library lies in a village nestling within the dense forests of idukki a primary school teacher p k muralidharan and p v chinnathampi who runs a small tea shop have between them worked tirelessly for this library there was a time when the books were brought here stuffed in sacks and carried on the back today this library is a beacon guiding tribal children on a new path the vaanche gujarat campaign carried out in gujarat was a successful experiment participants hailing from every age group in lakhs participated in this campaign to read books i will still urge you in today s digital world and in the time of google guru to take some time out from your daily routine and devote it to the book you will really enjoy it a lot and do write about whichever book you read on the narendramodi app so that all the listeners of mann ki baat also get to know about it my dear countrymen i am happy that the people of our country are thinking about issues which are posing a challenge not only at the present but also the future i was reading your comments on narendramodi app and mygov and i saw that many people have written a lot about the prevailing water problem pawangaurai of belagavi sitanshu mohan parida of bhubaneswar yash sharma shahabaltaf and many others have written about the challenges related with water water is of great importance in our culture rigveda sapahsuktam says this about water meaning that it is water which is the life force and also the source of energy please bless us like a mother and may your blessings continue on to be showered upon us water scarcity affects many parts of the country every year you will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from rains in the entire year is harvested in our country just and just 8 now the time has come to find a solution to this problem i believe like the other problems on hand we can also solve this predicament by the participation of the people janbhagidariand their power janshakti we are bound to find a solution through the strength cooperation and resolution of one hundred and thirty crore citizens therefore keeping the importance of water in mind a new jalashakti ministry has been created in the country this will allow faster decision making on all subjects related to water a few days ago i tried to do something different i wrote a letter to the sarpanchs and gram pradhans across the country that in order to save water to collect water to save the very drops of the rainwater they should convene a meeting of the gram sabha and sit and discuss the resolution to this problem with the villagers i am happy that they have shown exemplary enthusiasm on this front and on 22nd of this month crores of people contributed free labour shramdaanacross thousands of panchayats people in village after village resolved to accumulate every single drop of rainwater today i want to narrate the story of a sarpanch in the mann ki baat programme come let s listen to what the sarpanch of lupungpanchayat of katakmasandi block in hazaribagh district of jharkhand has to say to all of us through this message dilip kumar ravidas this is birsamunda s land where cohabiting in harmony with nature is a part of the culture the people here once again are ready to play their active role in water conservation for my part i wish good luck to all the village heads and all the sarpanchs for their dynamism there are several sarpanchs across the country who have taken the lead in water conservation in a way entire villages have grasped this opportunity as collective responsibility and it seems that the denizens of the villages have become involved in the competition for raising a water temple in their respective villages as i ve said a collective effort begets massive positive results there cannot be a single formula for dealing with water crisis across the country for this efforts are being made in different parts of the country in diverse ways but the goal remains the same and that is to save water and adopt water conservation the drainage lines are being fixed in punjab this effort would rid of the problem of water logging the construction of the water tank in telangana sthimmaipalli is changing the lives of the people of the village there has been a major change through construction of small ponds in the fields at kabirdham in rajasthan i was reading about the collective endeavour in vellore of tamilnadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the nag river i have also read about those women of garhwal who are working together on the good work of implementing rainwater harvesting i believe that many such attempts are being made and we can turn impossible in to possible when we are together and strive with collective resolve when people will join hands water will be conserved today through the mann ki baat programme i am entreating 3 requests to the fellow countrymen my first request is that just like cleanliness drive has been given the shape of a mass movement by the countrymen let s also start a mass movement for water conservation we together should all resolve to save every drop of water and i believe that water is god s prasad to us water is like philosopher s stone earlier it was said that by the touch of philosopher s stone iron could be transmuted in to gold i tell you water is philosopher s stone and its mere touch creates and regenerates life let us start an awareness campaign to save even a single drop of water in this campaign not only should we focus on water related problems but propagate ways to save water as well i specifically urge the luminaries belonging to different walks of life to lead promotion of water conservation through innovative campaigns whether it be from the world of films sports our friends in the media people belonging to social organizations people associated with cultural organizations or people involved in conducting devotional congregations such as katha kirtan everyone should lead this movement in their own fashion we must wake up the society unite the society and join the society in this endeavour you ll see we will find change occurring in front of our own eyes my second request to the countrymen is to share many traditional methods that have been in use over the centuries in our country for the conservation of water i urge all of you to share these traditional methods of water conservation if any of you gets an opportunity to go to porbandar the place of birth of revered bapu then there is a house behind the house of revered bapu where a 200 year old water tank still exists it is still capable of storing water and has a mechanism to harvest rain water as i always say that whosoever visits kirtimandir should also pay a visit to that water tank and there must be many types of such examples of experimentation in water conservation throughout our nation my third request to all of you is that share the information concerning the people who are making significant contributions towards water conservation ngos and everyone else associated in the area of water conservation in order to create an intensive database of individuals and organizations dedicated to water preservation come let us join water conservation and involve ourselves in making a list of more and more innovative methods to motivate people to conserve water you can all share your content using the janshakti4jalshakti hashtag my dear countrymen i must express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world for one more thing on 21st june once again yoga day was celebrated together with fervor and enthusiasm there were instances of three four generations of each family coming together to participate on yoga day the awareness about holistic health care has enhanced the glory of yoga and yoga day in any corner of the world yoga enthusiast welcomes the sun as soon it rises and then there is the complete journey ending with sunset there must hardly be a place where a human being exists without a bond with yoga yoga has assumed such an iconic form in india over the himalayas across the indian ocean from the lofty heights of siachen to the depths of a submarine from air force to aircraft carriers from air conditioned gyms to hot desert and from villages to cities wherever possible yoga was not just practiced everywhere but was also celebrated collectively the presidents prime ministers celebrities and ordinary citizens of many countries of the world showed me on the twitter how they celebrated yoga in their respective nations on that day the world appeared to be like one big happy family we all know that healthy and sensitive denizens are required to build a healthy society and yoga ensures this very principle therefore promotion of yoga is a great example of social service should we not recognize such service and bestow it with honour in the year 2019 the announcement of prime minister s awards for excellence in the promotion and development of yoga was a matter of great satisfaction for me this award would be bestowed on those organizations around the world whose significant and unique contributions in the promotion of yoga you cannot even imagine for example take japan yoga niketan which has made yoga popular throughout japan japan yoga niketan runs many institutes and conducts various training courses italy s ms antoniettarozzi has started sarv yoga international and popularized yoga throughout europe these are inspirational examples in themselves if there is a topic related to yoga then can indians lag behind others the bihar yoga vidyalaya in munger dedicated to yoga from past many decades was also honoured similarly swami rajarsrhi muni the founder of life mission and lakulish yoga university was also honoured the widespread celebration of yoga and honouring those missionaries taking yoga to the doorsteps of the common folk made this yoga day special my dear countrymen we re embarking on a new journey from today armed with new emotions new realizations new resolve and renewed vigour but yes i will keep on waiting for your suggestions the process of linking with your thoughts through mann ki baat as a medium is a very important and personal journey for myself let us keep on meeting and keep on talking let me keep on listening to your thoughts let me keep on understanding and cherish them let me sometimes try to live those very emotions may your blessings remain there for me you are my inspiration and you are my energy let s sit together and while enjoying mann ki baat try to fulfill the responsibilities of life once again next month we will meet again for another episode of mann ki baat i

water conservation pm narendramodi mannkibaat i wrote a letter to gram pradhans on the importance of water conservation and how to take steps to create awareness on the subject across rural india pm narendramodi mannkibaat there is no fixed way to conserve water in different parts different methods may be adopted but the aim is same to conserve every drop of water mannkibaat let us conserve every drop of water mannkibaat ,India resuming its series of touching upon matters close to people and their hearts in fact subjects close to every person 's heart i am once again amidst you with our mann

30-May-21,"In the May 30, 2021 episode of Mann Ki Baat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the collective efforts and resilience of the Indian people during the COVID-19 pandemic and other natural disasters, emphasizing the importance of saving lives. He acknowledged the heroic efforts of individuals like Dinesh Upadhyay, an oxygen tanker driver, and Shirisha Gajni, a loco pilot of the Oxygen Express, highlighting their commitment to delivering life-saving oxygen to those in need. Modi also expressed gratitude to the armed forces, scientists, and technicians who played pivotal roles in the COVID-19 response. He discussed the role of lab technicians who have worked tirelessly to conduct tests and manage samples, and emphasized the importance of safety measures. Modi celebrated the accomplishments of Indian farmers, who achieved record crop production during the pandemic, and highlighted efforts to export Indian products like jackfruit, litchi, and mangoes to international markets. The Prime Minister also reflected on the seven-year journey of his government, emphasizing the significance of teamwork, innovation, and dedication in achieving remarkable results across various sectors, including healthcare, infrastructure, and digital transactions. He encouraged continued collective efforts in the fight against COVID-19 and expressed his confidence in India's ability to overcome the crisis.",30-may-2021 my dear countrymen namaskar we are seeing how the country is fighting against covid 19 with all her might this has been the biggest pandemic in the last hundred years and during this very pandemic india has confronted many a natural disaster with fortitude meanwhile there were cyclone amphan and cyclone nisarg many states had floods there were many minor and major earthquakes there were landslides just recently in the past ten days the country faced two major cyclones cyclone taukte on the west coast and cyclone yaas on the east coast both these cyclones affected a number of states the country and her people fought them with all their strength ensuring minimum loss of life we experience now that compared to earlier times we are being able to save the lives of maximum people under these trying and extraordinary calamitous

people who ve played a major role in the fight against the second wave of corona many listeners of mann ki baat on namoapp and through letters have urged me to touch upon these warriors friends when the second wave came the demand for oxygen surged all of a sudden this was a very big challenge delivering medical oxygen to remote parts of the country was indeed a huge task if an oxygen tanker moves fast the slightest error can lead to the risk of a big explosion many plants manufacturing industrial oxygen are located in the eastern parts of the country transporting oxygen from there to other states of the country requires many days in confronting this challenge the country was helped by cryogenic tanker drivers the oxygen express and air force pilots many such people worked on a war footing saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of people joining us in mann ki baat today is one such friend shriman dinesh upadhyay ji resident of jaunpur u p modi ji dinesh ji namaskar dinesh

work and the resultant mental pressure one undergoes friends at this very moment of challenge to facilitate transportation of oxygen indian railway too has stepped forward oxygen express oxygen rail has transported larger quantities of oxygen to all corners of the country faster than oxygen tankers travelling by road mothers and sisters would be proud to hear that one oxygen express is being run fully by women every woman of the country will feel proud at that not just that every indian will feel proud i have invited shirisha gajni a loco pilot of oxygen express to mann ki baat modi ji

undergo shirisha i felt happy in doing this work during oxygen special time i observed all safety wise formation wise and for any leakage next indian railway too is supportive sir i was given green

the other work on construction of new oxygen plants too is being completed along with that oxygen oxygen concentrators and cryogenic tankers from abroad also are being brought into the country that is why in this task navy air force army and our institutions like drdo are also involved so many of our scientists industry experts and technicians too are working on a war footing the countrymen are keen to know and to understand the work of all of them that is why group captain patnaik ji from the air force is joining us modi ji patnaik ji jai hind grp cpt sir jai hind sir i am group captain a k

soldiers of ours these warriors of ours for the work that they have done similarly millions of people are toiling day and night the tasks they are performing is not part of their routine work this type of disaster has hit the world in a hundred years we have met such a big calamity after a century therefore no one had any experience of this kind of work behind it lies the spirit of service for the country and power of resolve this is why the country has been able to do work that has never been done before you can guess for yourself in normal circumstances we used to produce 900 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen in a day now it has expanded to generating more than 10 times the normal output and producing around 9500 metric tonnes per day our warriors are transporting this oxygen to far flung corners of the country my dear countrymen so many efforts were made in the country to distribute and provide oxygen so many people came together that as a citizen all these endeavors inspire you everyone has done their duty as part of a team i have been told by urmila ji from bengaluru that her husband is a lab technician and how he has been continuously performing task of testing in the midst of so many challenges friends at the beginning of corona there was only one testing lab in the country but today more than two and a half thousand labs are in operation initially only a few hundred tests could be conducted in a day now more than 20 lakh tests are being carried out in a single day so far more than 33 crore samples have been tested in the country this huge task is made possible only because of our colleagues like those mentioned there are countless frontline workers engaged in the work of sample collection going amidst infected patients and taking their sample is an example of yeoman service to protect themselves these friends have to wear ppe kit continuously even in sweltering heat after that the sample reaches the lab therefore when i was reading your suggestions and queries i decided that these friends engaged in such services should also be discussed we will also get to know a lot from their experiences so now let s talk to our friend prakash kandpal ji who works as a lab technician in delhi modi ji prakash ji namaskar prakash ji namaskar respected prime minister ji modi ji prakash ji first of all tell about yourself to all of our listeners of mann ki baat how long have you been doing this work and what has been your experience during the time of corona because the people of the country neither get to see you on television nor appear in newspapers even then working and living in the lab like a sage so i would like that through your account the countrymen will also get information about how work is going on in the country prakash ji i have been working as a lab technician for the last 10 years in the hospital called institute of liver and biliary sciences an autonomus institution under the government of delhi my experience in health sector is of 22 years even before ilbs i have worked in prestigious institutions like apollo hospital rajiv gandhi cancer hospital rotary blood bank delhi sir although in all of these medical institutions i served in the blood bank department but since 1st april 2020 last year i have been working in the covid testing lab under the virology department of ilbs undoubtedly during the covid pandemic there was a lot of strain on all the means and resources related to health but i personally consider this phase of cataclysm as an opportunity during which the nation humanity society expects and hopes for display of all that more responsibility cooperation strength and capability from us and sir when according to the expectation and hope of the nation humanity and society we function at our optimum which is equal to a drop of water we work according to those standards and measure upto them then there is a feeling of pride sometimes when our family members are apprehensive or even a little scared on such an occasion i remind them that the soldiers of our country on the borders who are always away from their families protecting the country in dire and extraordinary circumstances compared to them whatever risk we undertake is less is very less so they too understand this thing and in a way they also cooperate with me and they also contribute in whatever kind of cooperation there is during the time of this calamity modi ji prakash ji on one hand the government is advocating everyone to keep a distance or maintain distance from each other during the corona pandemic and you have to be in the midst of the corona virus by being at the forefront you have to encounter it from the front so it is a life threatening affair in itself and therefore it is very natural for the family to be worried but still this lab technician s job is one of the common professions and in such a pandemic another dimension gets added to the work that you are doing therefore the working hours must have increased you must be spending many an overnight in the lab and because so many crores of people are being tested the burden must have also increased but for your own safety also do you take precautions or not prakash ji yes sir we do our ilbs lab is accredited by who and thus all the protocols observed are of international standards we follow the three tier safety protocol with regards to our dress we go to lab in it and wearing it we work and then there is a complete protocol of discarding the dress another for labelling and also for testing we work under these protocols so sir it is god s grace that my family and most of my acquaintances are still untouched by this infection and there is one thing that if you are careful and observe caution you can avoid it to an extent modi ji prakash ji thousands of people like you have been stationed in the labs for the last one year and have been doing such arduous work saving innumerable people about which the nation is getting to know today prakash ji through you i thank all the members of your fraternity i thank you wholeheartedly on behalf of the countrymen and you stay healthy may you and your family stay healthy i wish you all the best prakash ji thank you prime minister ji i am very grateful to you for giving me this opportunity mr modi thank you brother pm modi friends i may have conversed with bhai prakash ji but in way through his words the fragrance of service rendered by thousands of lab technicians is reaching us in his words you not only get a glimpse of the sense of service evident in thousands and lakhs of people but we also come to realize our responsibility the kind of hard work and commitment that our friends like bhai prakash ji are putting in their work that very quantum of cooperation from them will greatly help in defeating corona my dear countrymen while at present we were discussing our corona warriors we have been a witness of their dedication and hard work in the last one and a half years but there also has been a very big role in this fight displayed by many such warriors across the country think for yourself our country faced such a big crisis that it affected every system of the country the agricultural sector protected itself from this attack to a great extent not only did it keep itself safe but the sector also progressed moving forward do you know that even in this pandemic our farmers have achieved record produce the farmers produced record output and this time the country went on to procure record amount of crops this time in many places farmers have got more than the minimum support price msp for mustard due to the record food grain production our country has been able to provide support to every countryman today 800 million underprivileged denizens are being provided free ration in this hour of crisis so no such a day ever occurs in a needy home when the stove is not lit friends today the farmers of our country are doing wonders in many areas by taking advantage of the new arrangements take for example the farmers of agartala these farmers produce very good jackfruit harvest anticipating their demand in the country and abroad this time the jackfruit of farmers of agartala was brought to guwahati by rail these jackfruit are now being sent to london from guwahati similarly you must have also heard the name of the shahi litchi of bihar in 2018 the government also gave gi tag to shahi litchi so that its identity would be reinforced and the farmers would get more benefits this time the shahi litchi of bihar has also been sent to london by air from east to west north to south our country is full of such unique flavors and products you must definitely have heard about the mangoes of vizianagaram in south india now who wouldn t like to eat this mango therefore now the kisan rail is ferrying hundreds of tons of vizianagaram mangoes to delhi the people of delhi and north india will get to eat vizianagaram mangoes and the farmers of vizianagaram will earn well the kisan rail has so far transported nearly 2 lakh tonnes of produce now the farmers are able to send fruits vegetables grains to other remote parts of the country at a very low cost my dear countrymen today on 30th may we are having mann ki baat and incidentally it also marks the completion of 7 years of the government over these years the country has followed the mantra of sabka saath sabka vikas sabka vishwas all of us have worked every moment with dedication in the service of the country many friends have sent me letters and said that in mann ki baat i should also discuss our mutual journey of 7 years friends whatever we have accomplished in these 7 years it has been of the country of the countrymen together we have experienced many moments of national pride in these years when we observe that now india moves ahead not with the thought and pressure of other countries but with her own conviction then we all feel proud when we witness that now india gives a befitting reply to those who conspire against us then our confidence soars when india does not compromise on the issues of national security when the strength of our armed forces increases we feel that yes we are on the right path friends i get messages and letters from countless countrymen spanning every corner of the country many people are thankful to the country that electricity has reached their village for the first time in 70 years that their sons and daughters are studying in the light under the fan many people say that our village too is now connected to the city by a paved road i remember some friends from a tribal area had sent me a message that after the road was built for the first time they felt that they too had joined the rest of the world similarly someone shares the joy of opening a bank account someone starts a new employment with the help of different schemes then they also invite me in sharing that happiness i keep receiving many invitations from our countrymen for the occasion of grihpravesh the house warming ceremony after receiving their home under the pradhan mantri awas yojana in these 7 years i have been associated with a million moments of your happiness just a few days ago a family from a village sent me a photo of the water tap installed in their house under the jal jeevan mission they had captioned the photo the lifeline of my village there are many such families in the 7 decades after independence only three and a half crore rural homes of our country had water connections however just in the last 21 months four and a half crore houses have been given clean water connections of these 15 months were of the corona period a similar confidence has come to the country through the ayushman yojana when the poor come home healthy with free treatment they feel that they have got a new life they feel confident that the country stands by them with the blessing of such families the blessings of crores of mothers our country is moving towards development with strength friends in these 7 years india has worked to show the world a new direction in digital transactions today you can make digital payments with absolute ease at any place it is proving very useful even in this time of corona today the seriousness and awareness of the countrymen towards cleanliness is increasing we are also launching record satellites and constructing record roads too in these 7 years many old contestations of the country have also been resolved with complete peace and harmony a new confidence of peace and development has arisen from the northeast to kashmir friends have you thought all such work which could not be achieved even in decades how were they done in these 7 years all this was possible because in these 7 years more than as the government or as the people we worked together as one country we worked as a team we worked as team india every citizen has tried to take a few steps forward in advancing the country yes where there are successes there are also trials in these 7 years together we have overcome many difficult tests as well and each time we have all emerged stronger in the form of the corona pandemic we are being continuously put to test this is a crisis that has plagued the whole world so many people have lost their loved ones even big countries were not spared from its devastation in the midst of this pandemic india is moving forward with the resolve of service and cooperation in the first wave we fought courageously this time too india will be victorious in the ongoing fight against the virus be it social distancing rules related to masks or vaccines there should be no letup in our efforts this indeed is the path to our victory next time when we meet in mann ki baat we will talk about many more inspiring examples of countrymen and discuss new topics do continue to keep sending me your suggestions may all of you stay healthy keep the country moving forward in this manner many many thanks ,"Modi praised the collective efforts and resilience of the Indian people during the COVID-19 pandemic and other natural

harmony, and social progress.",30-oct-2016 my dear countrymen my heartiest and best deepawali wishes to all of you deepawali is celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm throughout our country in india almost on all 365 days of the year one festival or the other is celebrated in some part of the country somebody watching from a distance would genuinely feel that festivity is a synonym for the indian way of life and this is natural too right from the vedic period to the present day there has been a tradition of festivities in india which of course has matched the occasions at different periods of time we have also witnessed the courage to do away with outdated traditions and the transformations in the manner of celebrating these festivals according to changing times and changing social mores have been accepted and adopted very naturally however we can very well discern one characteristic that this entire journey of indian festivals its widespread effect its depth its reach to each individual are all interlinked with one spirit which exhorts evolution from the self to the whole the collective existence the idea is that there should be a development of individuals and their personalities the limited scope of thinking must expand and cover not only the whole society but in fact the whole universe and this is achieved through these festivals indian festivals at times appear like community feasts but in that also the consciousness has been to there as to what should be or should not be eaten during that particular season what crop has been harvested by the farmers and how that yield is to be made a part of the festivities what food habits will be appropriate in a particular season from the health point of view our ancestors had very scientifically encompassed all these aspects in our festivals today the whole world is talking about the environment destruction of nature is a matter of great concern india s tradition of celebrating festivals has been one to strengthen our love for nature and to develop each individual right from childhood as a cultured person festivals have evoked a sense of responsibility towards everything be it trees plants rivers animals mountains birds etc nowadays we observe sunday as a holiday but in our older generations labourers fishermen and others from such sections of society used to observe holidays on new moon that is amavasya and full moon that is poornima and science has proved that on these days changes take place impacting the sea water other factors affect nature and these also influence the human mind thus we had developed the tradition to observe our holidays also intertwined with the phenomena of the universe keeping the scientific aspects in focus now when we celebrate diwali as i said each of our festivals carries a message and teaches us something the festival of lights deepawali conveys the message of tamso ma jyotirgamaya to move from darkness to light and this darkness here does not merely signify the absence of light it is also the darkness of superstition and blind faith darkness of ignorance darkness of poverty and also darkness of social evils by lighting lamps on diwali we try to overcome the darkness of these social shortcomings and individual blemishes attaining freedom from this darkness is the real essence of the festival of lights deepawali which we celebrate by lighting an earthen lamp a diya one thing that all of us know very well is that wherever in india we go whether to the home of the richest of the rich or to the humble dwelling of the poorest of the poor during the diwali festival we can see a cleanliness campaign going on in every household every nook and corner of the house is cleaned the less privileged also put in all their efforts to clean their modest earthen utensils because it is diwali time thus diwali also encompasses a campaign of cleanliness but the need of the hour is that not only individual houses but the entire premises all the neighbourhood the whole village be cleaned we have to expand and spread this habit and tradition now the festival of deepawali is not confined to the borders of india in almost all countries of the world deepawali is celebrated in one way or the other many governments in the world their parliaments and also their ruling classes are joining deepawali festivities from countries of the east to those of the west from developed nations to developing nations and from countries of africa to ireland everywhere we can see the glow and revelry of deepawali you may be aware that in america the us postal service has released a special postage stamp on deepawali this time the prime minister of canada has shared on twitter a picture of him lighting a lamp on the occasion of diwali british premier theresa may organised a reception in london involving all communities on deepawali in which she herself participated and there would hardly be a city in uk where diwali is not celebrated with a great pomp and show the prime minister of singapore has posted a picture on instagram and has shared it proudly with the whole world and what is that picture about it shows 16 women mps of singapore parliament standing outside the parliament all clad in indian sarees and this photo has gone viral all this has been done on the occasion of deepawali in singapore diwali celebrations are in full swing in almost all neighbourhoods the australian prime minister has conveyed his greetings to the indian community and has called upon all sections of societies to join in the diwali festivities in various australian cities the prime minister of new zealand had recently come to india he told me that he would have to go back soon as he had to participate in diwali celebrations there what i mean to say is that the festival of lights deepawali is becoming a festival of inspiration for the world community also to move from darkness to light on deepawali people adorn good clothes enjoy delicious food items and along with these there is also the bursting of fire crackers in a big way the children and the young people very much enjoy this bursting of crackers but at times children indulge in reckless bravado and take unnecessary risks they unwittingly invite a mishap in trying to create a big blast by joining and bursting many crackers together they are not even mindful of their surroundings which might have incendiary items leading to fire accidents news of such mishaps fire breakouts and even tragic casualties become a cause of big concern on deepawali to add to these woes there is a situation of even the doctors in big numbers being unavailable as they too are away celebrating deepawali with their families i specially urge the parents and guardians to be with their children with a watchful eye when they burst firecrackers so that there is no carelessness or undue audacity and accidents and mishaps are avoided in india the celebration of diwali lasts for a number of days it is not restricted to just one day with a string of festive events such as govardhan puja bhai dooj laabh panchmi till kartik purnima this festival of lights goes on for quite a long period of time alongside the festivities of deepawali we also prepare to celebrate chhathh pooja this chhathh pooja is a very important festival in the eastern parts of our country it is a big occasion there which lasts for four days but this also has a unique significance in that it gives a very special message to society chhathh upasana is actually an occasion to pray to the sun god who gives us so much directly and indirectly that it cannot even be measured by us and this chhathh pooja is for paying obeisance to the almighty sun but the adage is that people only pray to the rising sun however during the chhathh pooja people worship the setting sun as well there is a very profound social message behind this tradition when i speak of the deepawali festival or about the chhathh pooja this is actually an occasion to convey my best wishes to you but there is one more thing i have to do i have to specially thank my countrymen and express my gratitude to them in the backdrop of the disturbing incidents taking place during the past few months the soldiers of our defence forces have been sacrificing their all for our peace and happiness the sacrifice devotion and zeal of the jawans of our security forces occupies my mind and heart my emotional universe all the time and from that emanated my feeling and resolve that this diwali must be dedicated to our security forces i invited my countrymen to join the sandesh to soldiers campaign and today in all humility i wish to proclaim that there would not be a single soul in india who would not have unbounded love for our jawans a sense of deep pride in the members of our security forces the way these sentiments have been expressed is surely giving strength to each of our countrymen your messages to the jawans of our security forces have proved to be a great morale booster which cannot be easily imagined schools colleges students villages the underprivileged traders shopkeepers political leaders sportspersons people from the cine world have all lit a lamp for the country s jawans have joined in this campaign of sending a message of greetings and salutation to our jawans the media also made this festival of lights into an opportunity and an occasion to express gratitude towards our armed forces and why should it not be so our jawans from bsf crpf indo tibetan border police assam rifles navy army air force coast guard and many more as i am not able to include all by names are valiantly facing great hardships in the line of duty while we are celebrating diwali in the comforts of our homes some of these jawans are deployed in the desert areas others are guarding the towering himalayan peaks some are guarding our industrial establishments and some are maintaining security vigil at the airports what great responsibilities they have on their shoulders and so if we remember them also while we are in our festive mood our remembrance gets a new vigour which gets imparted to them also and they feel a new strength just one message can enhance their capability and our country has shown it i earnestly express my gratitude to all our countrymen and women for this gesture those who are artistically talented have expressed themselves through their art some persons prepared drawings made rangolis drew cartoons those blessed with the blessings of goddess saraswati composed poems and couplets some came up with inspiring and motivating slogans it appears that my narendramodiapp and mygov have been overwhelmingly filled with emotional messages in the shape of words in the form of pinchhi colours compositions etc encompassing innumerable emotions from all i can imagine how proud our soldiers feel at this moment many messages and other expression forms have been received on sandesh to soldiers hashtag as a symbol of these i would like to read a poem which has been sent by shriman ashwani kumar ashwani ji has written i celebrate the festival feel happy and smile i celebrate the festival fee happy and smile all this is because you are there i want to tell you today that you are the guardian of my freedom my gift of joy is there just because you are there i sleep peacefully i sleep peacefully because you are guarding the borders there the mountains the skies and the country bow to you the mountains the skies and the country bow to you i too bow in gratitude to you o brave soldier i too bow in gratitude to you o brave soldier my dear countrymen sister shivani whose parental side of the family as well as her family on the side of her in laws is full of army soldiers has sent me a telephone message let s hear what this representative of a military family says hello mr prime minister i am shivani mohan calling the sandesh to soldiers campaign has been launched on this deepawali and is proving to be a morale booster for our brothers i m from an army family my husband is an army officer my father and father in law both served as army officers also so we are full of soldiers on both sides of the family our soldiers and officers who are guarding our border have been receiving these affectionate messages and all in the army circle are getting tremendous inspiration and encouragement i would also like to say that along with army officers and soldiers their families and their wives also make sacrifices hence the entire army community is receiving a wonderful message and i would also like to wish you a happy diwali thank you my fellow citizens it is true that military personnel guard not only our borders but they stand as sentinels and fighters on every front of life be it a calamitous natural disaster or a law and order crisis or having to deal with enemies or to display courage in motivating misguided youth to return to the mainstream of life our jawans are motivated by a sense of patriotism while rendering service to the nation one incident has been brought to my attention and i also want to tell you that how at the core of success small things gather and become a force to reckon with you must have heard that himachal pradesh as a state is now open defecation free has attained the status of ofd the first state to achieve this was sikkim then himachal pradesh accomplished it and kerala is going to be ofd on november 1st but how is this success achieved well i ll tell you the reason one of the security personnel of itbp called vikas thakur is from a small village in sirmour district of himachal this village is called badhana now this itbp jawan of ours was in his village on holidays from his duty in the village at that time there was supposed to be a meeting of the gram sabha so he went to the meeting where a discussion about construction of toilets was in progress and he found that some of the families were unable to construct toilets due to lack of funds so vikas thakur of our itbp brimming with patriotism felt that no no this stigma must be eradicated see his patriotism for the country it is not that he serves the nation only by firing bullets on the enemies out came his cheque book and a cheque of fifty seven thousand rupees was handed to the head of the village panchayat with a request that the 57 households having no toilets be give one thousand rupees each from his side so that 57 toilets can get constructed and badhana becomes an open defecation free village vikas thakur demonstrated his heroics by contributing one thousand rupees each from his pocket to the 57 families and thus strengthening the cleanliness campaign and that is how himachal pradesh has been empowered to become an open defecation free state and similarly in kerala i really want to thank young people it came to my attention that in the remote forests of kerala where there is no path to tread upon and only after walking an entire day some villages can be reached with difficulty a tribal village panchayat named idmalakudi is there it is rarely visited by people it came to the attention of engineering students from the nearby urban areas that this village was in dire need of the toilets ncc cadets nss volunteers engineering students all together decided that the toilets will be constructed by them the building material needed to construct the toilets whether it was bricks or cement the entire construction material was carried by the young men on their shoulders spending an entire day walking in those forests and they themselves worked hard to construct toilets in that village thus achieving the goal of making a remote village in faraway forests open defecation free so that is the reason why kerala is on the verge of being declared free from open defecation the municipal councils and corporations in gujarat numbering over 150 have been declared free from open defecation 10 districts have also been declared free of open defecation there is also good news coming from haryana haryana is going to celebrate its golden jubilee on 1st november and in next few months haryana as an entire state will be freed from the stigma of open defecation as of now seven districts in haryana have got rid of open defecation work is progressing at a very rapid pace in all of these states i have mentioned the work being carried out in some of the places i convey my heartfelt thanks to all the citizens in these states who have joined in the task of eliminating from our country the darkness resulting from filth my fellow citizens the government plans for the welfare of the people through many of its schemes and usually when the second scheme follows the first one then the previous scheme is supposed to be discontinued but generally due attention is not paid to this the old schemes continue along with the newly implemented schemes and there is also a wait for the next scheme on the anvil this keeps on happening now in our country houses having a gas stove or those having electricity in the houses do not have a requirement for kerosene but who bothers about such things in the government what happens is that kerosene is also being provided so is cooking gas and so is electricity and then middlemen get a chance to usurp their cut from this i wish to greet the state of haryana which has pioneered a method of making haryana kerosene free by identifying homes having cooking gas connections or electricity through aadhar numbers and so far i ve heard that haryana has managed to make seven or eight districts absolutely kerosene free and with the pace at which this job has been undertaken i believe that the entire state will soon be completely kerosene free just imagine the change that would be ushered in theft will stop the environment would benefit and we will save our precious foreign exchange and the common folk will get facilities the only people feeling uncomfortable would be the dishonest persons and the middle men my dear countrymen mahatma gandhi is our guide forever even today his words guide us in setting up the standards and determining the direction that our nation must follow gandhiji used to say that when you chalk out a plan you must first recall the face of the poor and weak and then decide whether the scheme you are going to be implementing will be of any benefit to the poor or not it should not bring any loss to him your decisions should be based on such a benchmark it is the need of the times that we ve to address the aspirations that have been arisen in the poor of our nation we have to help them in getting freed from their troubles in a stepwise manner whatever the old dogmatic thinking might have been but the society now must be freed from discrimination between our sons and daughters now our schools are having toilets for girls as well as for boys for our daughters this is the opportunity to experience an india free from discrimination the government undertakes massive immunization programs for our children and yet millions of children are still left out from being immunized and fall prey to diseases mission indradhanush is one such operation that involves a vaccination program covering those kids who got left out during previous immunization campaigns and empowers them with immunity against serious diseases in the twenty first century having darkness still prevailing in our villages is something that is not acceptable now and the rural electrification drive to free the villages of darkness this major campaign of electrification is proceeding successfully in fact it is proceeding as per the time schedule what will happen to the health of a poor mother how has to inhale smoke equal to that from 400 cigarettes while cooking food on a chulha which burns wood as fuel and all this even after so many years of attaining freedom we are trying to provide a smoke free life to 5 crore such families and we are successfully advancing in that direction the small trader the small businessman the vegetable vendor the milk vendor the one running a hair cutting salon has always been entrapped in the grip of the money lender repaying interest all his life the stand up scheme and jan dhan account scheme are aimed at freeing these people from the clutches of notorious moneylenders crediting money directly into bank accounts via aadhar aims at directly sending money to the beneficiaries for the common man this is an opportunity to come out of the grip of middlemen a campaign has to be started where the target will not only be limited to bring in reforms and transformation but also to obtain freedom from the problem and this is happening my dear countrymen tomorrow the 31st october is the birth anniversary of sardar vallabhbhai patel the great son of india who vowed to unite india and made this the sole object of his life on the one hand 31st october is the birth anniversary of sardar saheb the living legend of national unity and on the other this is also the death anniversary of smt gandhi we should and do pay homage to the memories of our great personalities but a phone call from a gentleman from punjab and his pain touched me pradhan mantriji namaskar sir i am jasdeep speaking from punjab sir as you know 31st october is sardar patel ji s birthday sardar patel is the great personality who devoted his whole life to unite the country and i think he succeeded fully in this mission of his he brought everybody together but we may call it the country s misfortune that on this day itself indira gandhi ji was assassinated and as we all know what terrible events took place after her assassination sir i want to know how we can check such unfortunate events and incidents from taking place my dear countrymen this is not the pain of an individual person one sardar as history goes sardar vallabhbhai patel was the second great man after chanakya who carried on the stupendous job of uniting our country bringing independent india under one banner and accomplishing such a herculean task what a great man he was we bow a hundred times to that great soul but the pain remains that sardar patel who lived for india s unity strove tirelessly for it had to even endure some unpleasantness on account of it but never ever abandoned the path of unity but on the birth anniversary of this great sardar thousands of sardars the family members of thousands of sardars were killed in the aftermath of the assassination of smt gandhi these atrocities against sardars on the birth anniversary of that great personality who lived for unity that sardar is a page of history which causes pain to all of us but amidst all these turmoils we have to march forward chanting the mantra of unity unity in diversity is the strength of our country different languages different castes different attires different food habits and despite all these unity in diversity remains our binding strength that is india s great characteristic quality each generation has this responsibility the governments have this responsibility to explore possibilities of integration in each corner of the country and highlight the elements of our integration we should keep away from the idea of separatism or the attitude of separatism and also guard the country from any such ideology sardar saheb gave us one india now this is our collective responsibility to develop a great india a shreshtha bharat the mantra of national unity is the very foundation of a strong and great india sardar saheb s journey started with a struggle for farmers he was the son of a farmer sardar saheb had a big role in taking the freedom movement to the farmers making the freedom movement a source of strength in the villages was sardar saheb s big achievement a result of his organizational capacity and capability but sardar saheb was not just a man of struggle but also a man who created great things he believed in the cooperative movement today we often hear the name amul people of india and even those in other countries are familiar with every product of amul but only a few people would know that it was only through his farsightedness that sardar saheb envisioned the creation of a cooperative milk producers union in khera district which was at that time called kaira district he had given this idea in 1942 which now is before us in the shape of amul it is a living example as to how sardar saheb had foreseen the way to prosperity of the farmers i pay my respectful homage to sardar saheb and on 31st october on national unity day we must remember sardar saheb wherever we may be and take a resolve to preserve national unity my dear countrymen during diwali festivities kartik

uniform poise have in every situation various fruits and thekua are offered in the worship of chhath maiya the fasting in this is also not less than any difficult sadhna another special thing about

is now getting organized on a large scale in different districts of maharashtra along with delhi mumbai and many parts of gujarat i do remember that earlier in gujarat chhath pooja was not performed

sun god is solar energy solar energy is a subject today in which the whole world is looking at its future and for india the sun god has not only been worshiped for centuries but has also been the focus of our way of life today india is combining its traditional experiences with modern science that is why today we have become one of the largest countries to generate electricity from solar energy how solar energy is changing the lives of the poor and middle class of our country is also a subject of study in tamil nadu there is a farmer in kancheepuram thiru k ezilon he took the benefit of pm kusum yojana and got a solar pumpset of ten horsepower installed in his farm now they do not have to spend anything on electricity for their farm they are not even dependent on the government s electricity supply for irrigation in the field any more similarly in bharatpur rajasthan another beneficiary farmer of kusumyojana is kamalji meena kamal ji installed a solar pump in the field due to which his expenses have come down since the expense has come down the income also has increased kamalji is also connecting many other small industries with solar electricity there is timber work in their area there are products made from cow dung and solar electricity is also being used in them they are also giving employment to 10 12 people that is the fragrance of kamalji s initiative that started with kusum yojana has started reaching many people friends can you ever imagine that on using electricity for a month instead of getting your electricity bill you get paid for electricity solar energy has also demonstrated that a few days ago you must have heard a lot about the country s first solar village modhera of gujarat most of the houses in modhera surya gram have started

across the country the power of the sun will now save money and increase income manzoor ahmed larhwal is a friend from srinagar jammu and kashmir on account of winters in kashmir the cost of electricity is high for this reason manzoorji s electricity bill also used to be more than rs 4 thousand but since manzoorji has got a solar rooftop plant installed at his house his expenditure has come down to less than half similarly kunnideori a daughter from odisha is making solar energy a medium of employment for her as well as for other women kunni lives in kardapal village of kendujhar district of odisha she trains tribal women to spin silk on a solar powered reeling machine due to the solar machine these tribal women do not have to bear the burden of electricity bill and they are earning income this is the very boon of sun god s solar energy the more the boon and the blessings spread the better it is therefore i urge you to join this and add others too my dear countrymen just now i was talking to you about the sun now my attention is going towards space that is because our country is doing wonders in the solar sector as well as the space sector the whole world today is surprised to see the achievements of india so i thought by telling this to the listeners of mann ki baat i should make them happy too friends you must have seen a few days ago that india has placed 36 satellites in space simultaneously this success achieved just a day before diwali in a way it is a special diwali gift from our youth to the country with this launching from kashmir to kanyakumari and from kutch to kohima in the whole country digital connectivity will be further strengthened with the help of this even the remotest areas will be more easily connected with the rest of the country when the country is self reliant how it reaches new heights of success this is also an example of this while talking to you i also remember those old days when india was denied the cryogenic rocket technology but the scientists of india not only developed indigenous technology but today with the help of it dozens of satellites are being sent to space simultaneously with this launching india has emerged as a strong player in the global commercial market with this new doors of oppurtunities have also opened up for india friends our country which is moving with the resolve of a developed india can achieve its goals only with the efforts of everyone earlier in india the space sector was confined within the purview of government systems since the space sector was opened for india s youth and revolutionary changes have started coming in it indian industries and start ups are engaged in bringing new innovations and new technologies in this field in particular the collaboration of in space is going to make a big difference in this area non government companies are also getting the facility to launch their payloads and satellites through in space i would urge more and more start ups and innovators to take full advantage of these huge opportunities being created in india in the space sector my dear countrymen when it comes to students youth power leadership power so many outdated stereotypes have become ingrained in our mind many times we see that when student power is referred to its scope is limited by linking it with the student union elections but the scope of student power is very big very vast student power is the basis of making india powerful after all it s the youth of today who will take are today will take india till 2047 when india celebrates her centenary this power of youth their hard work their sweat their talent will take india to the heights that the country is resolving today the way our youth of today are working for the country and have joined

youth of the country together have solved many challenges have given new solutions to the country friends you may remember i had called for jai anusandhan from the red fort i had also talked about making this decade the techade of india i loved seeing this our iit s students have also taken over its command this month on 14 15 october all 23 iits came on one platform for the first time to showcase their innovations and research projects in this fair students and researchers who came from all over the country displayed more than 75 best projects healthcare agriculture robotics semiconductors 5g communications these projects were made on many such themes although all these projects were one better than the other i want to draw your attention to some projects for example a team from iit bhubaneswar has developed a portable ventilator for new born babies it runs on battery and can be used easily in remote areas this can prove to be very helpful in saving the lives of babies who are born prematurely be it electric mobility drone technology 5g many of our students are engaged in developing new technology related to them several iits are also working together on a multilingual project that makes learning local languages easier this project will help the new national education policy a lot in achieving those goals as well you will also be happy to know that iit madras and iit kanpur have played a leading role in preparing india s indigenous 5g testbed this is certainly a great start i hope to see many more such efforts in the times to come i also hope that taking inspiration from iits other institutions will also step up their r d activities my dear countrymen sensitivity towards the environment is embedded in every particle of our society and we can feel it all around us there is no dearth of people in the country who spend a lifetime in the protection of the environment we can also learn a lot from suresh kumar ji who lives in bangaluru karnataka he has a great passion for protecting nature and environment 20 years ago he had taken the initiative to rejuvenate a forest of sahakarnagar in the city it was a difficult task but these saplings that were planted 20 years ago have grown into 40 feet tall huge trees now their beauty captivates everyone s mind this also gives a feeling of great pride to the people living there suresh kumar ji also does another wonderful job he has also built a bus shelter in sahakarnagar to promote kannada language and culture he has also presented brass plates written in kannada to hundreds of people if both ecology and culture grow together and flourish just imagine how great it would be friends today more awareness is being seen among people about eco friendly living and eco friendly products than ever before i also got a chance to know about one such interesting endeavor from tamil nadu this is a brilliant effort by a team of tribal women in anaikatti coimbatore these women crafted ten thousand eco friendly terracotta tea cups for export the amazing thing is that these women themselves took up the entire responsibility of making the terracotta tea cups from clay mixing to final packaging they did all the work themselves they had also taken training for this whatever praise is showered on this wonderful effort is little friends some villages of tripura have also set very good examples you must have heard about bio village but some villages of tripura have ascended to the level of bio village 2 bio village 2 emphasizes how to minimize the damage caused by natural disasters in this full attention is given to improve the quality of life of the people through various measures there is complete focus on solar energy biogas bee keeping and bio fertilizers overall bio village 2 is going to lend a lot of strength to the campaign against climate change i am very happy to see the increasing enthusiasm for environmental protection in different parts of the country

feel proud of our armed forces our army jawans our soldiers every indian irrespective of region caste religion sect or language is ever eager to express joy and show solidarity with our soldiers yesterday one hundred and twenty five crore indians celebrated the paraakramparva the festival of valour we remembered that surgical strike carried out in 2016 where our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the audacity of a proxy war under the garb of terrorism at various places in the country exhibitions have been organised by our armed forces in order to apprise the maximum number of citizens especially the younger generation of the might we possess how capable we are and how our soldiers risk their lives to protect us citizens a day such as paraakaramprava reminds our youth of the glorious heritage of our army it also inspires us to maintain the unity integrity of the country i too participated in a programme held at jodhpur in the land of the valiant rajasthan it has now been decided that our soldiers will give a befitting reply to whosoever makes an attempt to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our nation we staunchly believe in peace we are committed to taking it forward but not at the cost of compromising our self respect and sovereignty of our nation india has always been resolutely committed to peace in the two world wars fought in the 20th century over a lakh of our soldiers made the supreme sacrifice that too in a war where we were not involved in any way we have never eyed someone else s territory maliciously this in itself was our commitment dedication towards peace a few days ago on the 23rd of september on the occasion of the centenary of the battle of haifa in israel we remembered paid tributes to our brave soldiers of mysore hyderabad jodhpur lancers who had freed haifa from the clutches of oppressors this too was an act of valour on part of our soldiers on the path to peace even today india is one of the largest contributors to various united nations peace keeping forces in terms of sending forces personnel for decades our brave soldiers wearing blue helmets have played a stellar role in ensuring maintenance of world peace my dear countrymen the sky offers the rarest of hues it is not at all surprising that the indian air force has proved itself to be the cynosure of every citizen s eye through the display of sheer might in the skies it has bestowed upon us a sense of security one of the notable features eagerly awaited by spectators during the republic day parade is the flypast comprising the magnificent display of the might of our air force through their breath taking aerobatic manoeuvres we celebrate air force day on the 8th of october making a humble beginning in 1932 with six pilots and 19 airmen our air force has emerged as one of mightiest and the bravest air force of the 21st century today from the core of my heart i congratulate those air warriors and their families who rendered service to the nation in 1947 when pakistani attackers resorted to an unprecedented attack it was indeed our air force which ensured that indian soldiers and armaments reached the battlefield promptly the air force also retaliated befittingly in 1965 too who does not know about the bangladesh freedom struggle of 1971 the air force played a very significant role in 1999 by pushing back the intruders and liberating kargil from their clutches the air force defeated the enemy at tiger hill by carrying out air sorties on their positions round the clock be it the relief and rescue work or disaster management our country is indebted to our air force for the commendable efforts of our air warrior they have always displayed a unique spirit in times of natural calamities like storms cyclones floods and forest fires to extend full assistance to our countrymen the air force has set an example in ensuring gender equality and has opened its doors for our daughters of india now the air force is offering the option of permanent commission to women besides the short service commission which i had announced on the 15th of august this year from the red fort indian can proudly claim that in the armed forces our army not only man power but woman power too is contributing equally women are already empowered and now getting armed too my dear countrymen a few days ago officer abhilashtomy of our navy was struggling between life and death the whole country was concerned about saving tomy you know abhilashtomy is a very courageous brave soldier he was the first indian who set on a global voyage in a small boat without any modern technology for the last 80 days he was moving ahead in south indian ocean to participate in the golden globe race maintaining his speed but suddenly a severe cyclonic storm landed him in trouble yet this brave heart from the navy kept struggling for many days in mid ocean he fought to be afloat without food or drink he did not accept defeat and continued to fight death a rare example of courage determination strength and bravery a few days ago i talked to abhilash over the telephone after he was rescued and brought safely ground i had met tomy earlier too despite having faced such a tough situation his grit spirit his determination to make another similar attempt is an inspiration for our younger generation i pray for tomy s sound health and i am sure that his courage bravery and resolve to fight and emerge a winner will inspire our younger generation my dear countrymen every child in our country knows the importance of the 2nd of october for our nation the 2nd of october this year has a special significance for two years from now on we are going to organise various programmes throughout the world on the 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi mahatma gandhi s philosophy has inspired the whole world everyone including great personalities like dr martin luther king and nelson mandela derived strength from gandhiji s ideology to be able to fight a long battle to ensure right of equality and dignity for the people in today s mann ki baat i want to talk about another important work of revered bapu which maximum countrymen should know in 1941 mahatma gandhi started penning down a few thoughts in the shape of a constructive programme later in 1945 when the freedom struggle gained momentum he prepared an amended copy of those ideas revered bapu put forth his ideas on various subjects like farmers villages securing of labour rights cleanliness and promoting of education this is also known as the gandhi charter revered babu was a people s person getting connected with people or connecting people with him was bapu s special quality this was in his nature everyone has experienced this as a most unique part of his personality he made everyone feel that he or she was very important and absolutely necessary for the country his biggest contribution in the freedom struggle was that he made it an expansive jan aandolan people s movement during the freedom struggle people from all sections and all regions dedicated themselves at mahatma gandhi s call bapu gave an inspirational mantra to all of us which is known as gandhiji s talisman in that gandhiji had said i give you one mantra whenever you are in doubt or whenever your ego gets over your personality undergo this test remember the face of the poorest or the weakest person that you have seen recall his looks and ask your inner self how useful your intended step would be for that person will this in anyway benefit him will he be able to get some control over his life and destiny through your step meaning thereby that will your step help millions of those people in getting swaraj who have an empty stomach and a dissatisfied soul then you will see that your doubt is waning away and your ego is also getting quelled my dear countrymen one of gandhiji s mantras is very relevant event today the swelling middle class of the country its increasing economic power increasing purchasing power can we remember revered bapu for a moment while going out for shopping can we remember that mantra of bapu can we spare a thought while purchasing anything as to who in my country will be benefitted by this purchase whose face will sport a smile who will be the fortunate one to get a direct or indirect benefit from your purchase i will feel much happier if my purchase will benefit the poorest of the poor keeping this mantra of gandhiji in mind while making any purchases during the 150th anniversary of gandhiji we must make it a point to see that our purchase must benefit one of our countrymen and in that too one who has put in physical labour who has invested money who has applied skill must get some benefit this is the mantra of gandhiji this is the message of gandhiji and i firmly believe that a small step of yours can surely bring about a very big benefit in the life of the poorest and the most underprivileged person my dear countrymen when gandhiji said that by maintaining cleanliness freedom will be won then he probably was not aware how this would happen but this did happen and india got freedom in the same way today we may feel that even by making a tiny contribution i may be contributing in a big way to help in the economic upliftment and economic empowerment of my country and help fight a battle against poverty by lending strength to the poor i feel that this is true patriotism and a perfect tribute to revered bapu s work for example think of purchasing khadi and handloom products on special occasions this will benefit many weavers it is said that lalbahadurshastriji used to preserve old and worn out khadi clothes because some one s labour could be felt in the making of those clothes he used to say that all these khadi clothes have been woven after putting in a hard labour every thread of these clothes must be utilized this spirit of attachment towards the country and fellow countrymen was deeply imbibed in that great person of a very short physical stature two days later we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of shastriji along with respected bapu s birth anniversary the very name of shastriji evokes a feeling of eternal faith in the hearts of us indians his mild persona always fills every indian with a sense of pride lalbahadurshastriji had a unique quality in that he was very humble outwardly but he was rock solid from inside his slogan jai jawan jai kisan is the hall mark of his grand personality it was the result of his selfless service to the nation that in a brief tenure of about one and a half years he gave to our jawans and farmers the mantra to reach the pinnacle of success my dear countrymen while remembering revered bapu today it is quite natural not to skip talking of cleanliness a movement swachhta hi sewa was launched on the 15thof september crores of people got connected with this movement and luckily i also got a chance to participate in the voluntary cleanliness shramdaan with the children of delhi s ambedkar school i went to the school the foundation of which had been laid by none other than respected baba saheb himself on the 15th of september people from all sections across the country connected themselves to this voluntary cleaning movement institutions also extended their contribution enthusiastically school children college students ncc nss youth organisations media groups the corporate world all of them offered voluntary cleanliness service on a large scale i heartily congratulate all these cleanliness loving countrymen for their efforts come on let us listen to a phone call many many thanks you ve made a significant remark that cleanliness has a specific meaning in every one s life and what could be a matter of immense joy for all of us than the fact that a toilet has been built in your house under the swachh bharat abhiyan and that all of you have the facility now and possibly those connected with this movement may not be able to guess that you cannot see because of your visual challenge but one understands the difficulties you were facing when there was no toilet and that the construction of this toilet has really proved to be a big boon for you if you had not made a call about this aspect perhaps those connected with this cleanliness movement might have also not thought about such a sensitive issue i specially thank you for your phone call my dear countrymen swachh bharat mission or clean india mission has become a success story not only in our country but in the whole world and everyone is talking about this movement this time india is hosting the biggest sanitation convention of the world so far the mahatma gandhi international sanitation convention sanitation ministers from countries across the world and experts on the subject of sanitation will converge and share their experiments and experiences mahatma gandhi international sanitation convention will conclude on 2nd october 2018 with the commencement of bapu s 150th birth anniversary celebrations my dear countrymen there is a sanskrit quote nyayamoolamswarajyamsyat meaning justice lies at the root of swaraj and while discussing the subject of justice the spirit of human rights is inherent in that this is specially essential for the freedom and peace of the exploited victimised and deprived people and to ensure justice for them in the constitution drafted by dr baba saheb ambedkar many provisions were inserted to protect the fundamental rights of the poor inspired by his vision the national human rights commission nhrc was formed on 12th october 1993 a few days later nhrc would complete 25 years of its existence the nhrc has not only protected human rights but has also promoted respect for human dignity over the years our most beloved leader shriatalbihari vajpayee the former prime minister of our country had clearly said that human rights are not analien concept for us in the emblem of our national human rights commission the ideal mantra harking back to vedic period sarvebhavantusukhinah is inscribed nhrc has instilled widespread awareness of human rights and has played an important role in preventing their misuse in its journey of 25 years it has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence in the countrymen for a healthy society and for lofty democratic values i feel that it is a very hope inspiring event today with nhrc operating at the national level 26 state human rights commissions have also been constituted as a society we need to understand the importance of human rights and inculcate them into practice this is the very basis of sab kasaath sab kavikas my dear countrymen the month of october heralds jai prakash narayan ji s birth anniversary the beginning of the birth centenary of rajmatavijayarajescindiaji these luminaries have been infusing inspiration in all of us and we offer our heartfelt tributes to them 31 october

occasion of sardar sahib s birth anniversary on october 31 is marked in every small town and district by organizing the run for unity race even this year we should try to organize run for unity in our

casteism communalism terrorism and corruption free from filth and poverty in the new india everyone will have equal opportunity and aspirations and wishes of everyone will be fulfilled new india will

decide a way for connecting along those attached to one and the caravan should get going you should move forward and thus should the country move ahead right now while taking to you i got an idea whether we could organize a mock parliament in every district of india where the youth between 18 and 25 could sit together and brain storm about new india find ways and chalk our plans how could we realize our resolves before 2022 how could we build an india of the dreams of our freedom fighters mahatma gandhi had transformed the freedom movement into a mass movement my young friends the need of the hour is that we build up a mass movement for making a magnificent glorious 21st century india a mass movement of development a mass movement to build a capable and strong india i propose that a mock parliament be organized around the 15th august in delhi comprising one young representatives selected from every district of india who would participate and deliberate on how a new india could be formed in the next five years how can resolve be transformed into reality today a lot of new opportunities have been created for the youth our youth are coming forward in areas like skill development innovation and entrepreneurship and are achieving success i wish that the new india youth get information and details of all these new opportunities and plans at one place and a system be created so that every young person on turning 18 should automatically get to know all this and benefit from it my dear countrymen i had talked about positivity during the previous episode of mann ki baat i am reminded of one sanskrit shloka utsaaho balwaanarya naastyutsaahaatparam balam sotsaahasya cha lokeshu na kinchidapi durlabham this means that a man full of enthusiasm is very strong since there is nothing more powerful than zest nothing is impossible for a man having positivity and zeal in english too it is said pessimism leads to weakness optimism to power during the previous episode of mann ki baat i had appealed to the countrymen to share their positive moments of 2017 and to welcome 2018 in a positive atmosphere i am very glad that a large number of people gave positive responses on social media platform mygov and the narendra modi app and shared their experiences lakhs of tweets were posted on positive india hashtag which reached out to more than nearly 150 crore people in a way a wave of positivity which emanated from india spread all over the world all tweets and responses received were really inspiring it was indeed a delightful experience some countrymen shared those incidents of this year which left a special impact on their minds a very positive one at that some people even shared their personal achievements sound bite my name is meenu bhatia i reside in mayur vihar pocket 1 phase i delhi my daughter wanted to do m b a i needed to take a bank loan which i got very easily and my daughter was able to continue her studies my name is jyoti rajendra waade i am speaking from bodal one rupee per month was being deducted towards insurance premium which my husband had subscribed to he died in an accident only we know of the situation we faced at that time assistance from the government helped us a lot and i could gather the strength to stand myself my name is santosh jadhav a national highway has been constructed in 2017 through our village bhinnar as a result of this our roads have improved a lot and business there will surely get a boost my name is deepanshu ahuja i live in mohalla saadatganj district saharanpur uttar pradesh two actions taken by our indian soldiers deserve a special mention one was the surgical strike carried out in pakistan which destroyed launching pads of terrorists and the second was the unique valour displayed by indian soldiers in doklam these are without parallel my name is satish bewani we had a problem of water scarcity in our area and we used to depend on an army pipeline for the last forty years now an independent pipeline has been constructed so this is our achievement in 2017 there are a large number of such persons who have brought in positive transformation in the lives of many people through endeavour at their own level in fact this is the new india which we are all collectively building let us enter into the new year with such little achievements begin our new year and take concrete steps in the journey from positive india to progressive india when we all talk of positivity i also feel like sharing one experience recently i came to know about the inspiring story of anjum bashir khan khattak who is a topper in kashmir administrative service examination he actually extricated himself from the sting of terrorism and hatred and topped in the kashmir administrative examination you will be surprised to know that terrorists had set his ancestral home on fire in 1990 terrorism and violence were so widespread there that his family had to leave their ancestral land and flee from there for a young child such an atmosphere of violence could easily create darkness and bitterness in the heart but anjum did not let it be so he never gave up hope he chose a different path for himself a path of serving the people he overcame the adverse situation and scripted his own success story today he has become a source of inspiration not only in jammu kashmir but for the youth of the whole country anjum has proved that however adverse the circumstances be the clouds of despair and disappointment can easily be cleared by taking positive steps just last week i had a chance of meeting some daughters of jammu kashmir i was amazed at the spirit that they had the enthusiasm that was there in their hearts and the dreams they nurtured i was listening to them on how they wanted to make progress in various facets of life and how their lives were filled with hope i talked to them there was no sign of despair there was only enthusiasm optimism energy dreams and a sense of resolve whatever little time i spent with these daughters i got inspired myself these are the strength of our nation they are my youth they are the future of my country my dear countrymen whenever there is a reference to famous religious places not only of india but of the whole world it is very natural to mention about the sabrimala temple of kerala millions of devotees come to this world famous temple seeking blessings of lord ayyappa swami it is a huge challenge maintaining cleanliness around such a large religious place where devotees in such huge number come and especially since this place is situated in the midst of hills and forests but sabrimala temple in itself is an example to show how this challenge could be converted into a sanskar a habit and what a tremendous strength public participation has one police officer p vijayan initiated a programme punyam poonkavanam and commenced a voluntary campaign of creating awareness on cleanliness and he began a tradition that the yatra of devotees will remain incomplete if they do not contribute by performing some physical labour or the other in the cleanliness programme no one is big or small in this campaign every devotee considers doing physical labour in the cleanliness drive as a part of the lord s worship every morning there is a uniquely pleasant scene of cleanliness here when all devotees join in the drive however big a celebrity be or however rich one might be or however high an official be each one contributes as an ordinary devotee in this punyan poonkavanam programme and becomes a part of this cleanliness drive there are many such examples before us this cleanliness drive in sabrimala and the contribution of punyan poonkavanam in this are so immense that each devotee contributes and participates in it here a strong resolve of maintaining cleanliness also is as important as the strict discipline observed during worship my dear countrymen all of us made a resolve on bapu s birth anniversary on october 2 2014 to take forward bapu s unfinished task of building a clean india and a filth free india revered bapu fought for this cause all through his life and made all out efforts and all of us took a resolve that on the 150th birth anniversary of revered bapu we shall make some contribution in the direction of making clean india which he had dreamt of efforts in the direction of cleanliness are being widely taken across the whole country a change can now be seen in the form of public participation in rural and urban areas alike cleanliness survey 2018 the largest in the world will be conducted from the 4th of january to 10th of march 2018 to evaluate achievements in cleanliness level of our urban areas this survey will cover a population of more than 40 crores in more than four thousand cities during this survey the matters to be surveyed include freedom from defecation in the open in cities collection of garbage transport facilities to lift garbage processing of garbage using scientific methods efforts to usher in behavioural changes innovative steps taken for capacity building to maintain cleanliness and public participation in this campaign separate teams will go to cities for inspection they will talk to the people there and gather their reactions they will analyse the use of the cleanliness app and also about bringing reforms and improvements in various kinds of service centres it will also be observed whether the cities have created a system wherein cleanliness of cities will became public habit or the city s habit for that matter it is not for the government alone to maintain cleanliness every citizen and people s organizations have a big responsibility and i appeal to every citizen to actively participate in the cleanliness survey to be undertaken in the coming days and take the full onus to ensure that your city should not lag behind and your street or mohalla should not look to be wanting i am very sure that using blue and green dustbins to collect dry and wet garbage respectively must have become your habit by now for waste collection the principle of reduce reuse and re cycle is very effective now ranking of cities will be done on the basis of this survey if your city has a population of more than one lakh ranking will be done on the national level and if the population of your city is less than one lakh than it will be ranked on regional level achieving the highest ranking must be your dream and you should put all out efforts in this direction be sure that you do not remain lagging behind in the cleanliness survey to be conducted from 4th january to 10th march 2018 this should become the talking point in every city and all of you must have a dream our city our efforts our progress country s progress let us all once again remembering revered bapu and taking a resolve to build a clean india put in our best endeavours my dear countrymen there are a few things which appear small but they have a far reaching impact on our image as a society today in this episode of mann ki baat i want to share one such thing with you it has come to our notice that if a muslim woman wants to go on haj pilgrimage she must have a mehram or a male guardian otherwise she cannot travel when i first heard about it i wondered how it could be possible who would have drafted such rules why this discrimination and when i went into the depth of the matter i was surprised to find that even after seventy years of our independence we were the ones who had imposed these restrictions for decades injustice was being rendered to muslim women but there was no discussion on it even in many islamic countries this practice does not exist but muslim women in india did not have this right and i m glad that our government paid heed to this matter our ministry of minority affairs issued corrective measures and we ameliorated this restriction by phasing out a tradition that had been in practice for the past seventy years today muslim women can perform haj without mahram or male guardian and i am happy to note that this time about thirteen hundred muslim women have applied to perform haj without mahram and women from different parts of the country from kerala to north india have expressed their wish to go for the haj pilgrimage i have suggested to the ministry of minority affairs that they should ensure that all women who have applied to travel alone be allowed to perform haj usually there is a lottery system for selection of haj pilgrims but i would like that single women pilgrims should be excluded from this lottery system and they should be given a chance as a special category i not only reiterate this wholeheartedly but it is my firm belief that the journey of india s progress has been possible due to women power and on the basis of their talent and we will continue to march onwards on this path of progress it should be our constant endeavor that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities just like men get so that they can proceed simultaneously on the path of progress my dear countrymen 26th january is a historic festival for all of us but 26th january 2018

31-Jan-16,"In his Mann Ki Baat address on January 31, 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi began by reflecting on his visit to Rajghat to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi and the importance of observing 2 minutes of silence at 11 A.M. on January 30 each year as a national responsibility. He emphasized that such acts of unity hold great power.

The Prime Minister then discussed the significance of Khadi (hand-spun and hand-woven cloth) in Indian culture, and how it represents freedom, non-violence, and support for farmers. He commended efforts to promote Khadi in various government organizations, which could generate employment for millions.

PM Modi spoke about the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana, an insurance scheme for farmers, and called for efforts to ensure at least 50% of the country's farmers benefit from the scheme. He requested citizens to help spread awareness about the scheme, as it provides crucial support to farmers during crop failures.

He also touched on the success of the startup culture in India and encouraged people to share their experiences and ideas related to startups. The Prime Minister highlighted the citizens' role in beautifying railway stations and emphasized the importance of blending beauty with cleanliness.

Lastly, he announced the upcoming International Fleet Review and the South Asian Federation games, which signify India's strong maritime tradition and regional engagement. PM Modi also called on students to share their experiences and advice on exam preparation to create a supportive and tension-free environment for those taking final examinations.",31-jan-2016 my dear countrymen this is my first mann ki baat of 2016 mann ki baat has bonded me with you all in such a way that any idea that comes to me i feel like sharing with you yesterday i went to pay homage to respected bapu at rajghat every year we pay tributes to the martyrs on this day observing 2 minutes silence at sharp 11 a m is an occasion to express our gratitude to great and brave men sages and saints who have laid down their lives for the country however if we see there would be many among us who won t have maintained this 2 minutes silence don t you think that it should become a habit and we should take it up as a national responsibility i know that this will not happen with just one mann ki baat however i thought of sharing what i felt yesterday and these are the thoughts that inspire us to live for the country imagine 125 crore indians observing silence for 2 minutes at 11 a m on january 30 you can imagine the kind of power this event may have and it is true what our scriptures have said may you move in harmony speak in one voice let your minds be in agreement this is the true strength of a nation and the inspiration comes fom such events my dear countrymen i was trying to understand the thought process of sardar patel a few days ago when some of his ideas grabbed my attention with regards to khadi sardar patel said the freedom of india lies in khadi india s culture also remains in khadi non violence the ultimate religion that we believe in india is also in khadi and the farmers of india for whom you show so much of emotion their welfare too lies in khadi sardarji used simple language to put across his message in a clear way and he explained the importance of khadi in a proper way yesterday on 30th january during the occasion of death anniversary of respectful bapu i made an attempt to reach out to as many people associated with khadi and rural industries by writing letters to them well as you knowbapu was a supporter of science so i also used technology as a medium to reach these lakhs of brothers and sisters khadi has now become a symbol it has a different identity now khadi is becoming the centre of attraction for the young generation and has become a perfect solution for those who have an inclination for organic and holistic health care khadi has carved out a niche for itself in the fashion world my greetings to the people associated with khadi for their earnest efforts to bring something new in khadi market has its own importance in the economy in addition to the emotional value it is important that khadi makes a mark in the market itself when i told people that you have so many different types of garments then you should have khadi as well and now people are understanding that if they can t become a person using khadi only they can however have atleast one khadi in addition to the several garments in their closet the government organizations are witnessing a positive trend for khadi you may recall many years ago khadi was used extensively in the government organizations however it slowly began fading out of the scene in the name of modernization and those associated with the khadi industry were losing jobs khadi has the potential to provide employment to millions few days ago railway ministry police department indian navy postal department of uttarakhand and many such government organizations took intiatives to promote the use of khadi and i was told that efforts from the government organizations will result in more work for people in this sector will generate employment of additional 18 lakh man days to fulfill the requirements serve the needs of the government which in turn would be a big jump in itself respected bapu was always aware and insistent of technological up gradation and also remained in the forefront for the same and this is why with constant development our charkha has arrived to where it is now running charkha with solar and linking solar energy with charkha have become a successful experiment it has made it more efficient production is higher and there is an enhancement in quality of the yarn i have received many letters especially on the solar charkha geeta devi and komal devi from dausa in rajasthan and sadhna devi from nawada district in bihar have written to me saying that slar charkhas has made remarkable changes in their lives our income has doubled and there has been a rise in demand for our yarn all these things adds to enthusiasm and on january 30 when we rememeber respected bapu i repeat atleast make it necessary to keep one khadi among many of your garments and become an supporter for the same fellow citizens we all celebrated the 26th january with a lot of zeal and enthusiasm braving the terror threats citizens of our country showed courage and celebrated the republic day with pride and dignity but some people came out with an out of the box thinking i would like to emphasize that these innovations are worth paying attention especially the experiments of haryana and gujarat the two states selected the most educated girls from every village to do the flag hosting in government run schools in the states haryana and gujarat gave importance to the girls provided special importance to the educated girls beti bachao beti padhao they made an effort and sent a good message i congratulate the imagination of these two states and also congratulate all those girls who got the opportunity to host the flag last year in haryana something even unique happened the families wherein a girl child was born was invited as special guest and given the seat in the first row as a vip this was a huge moment of pride in itself and i am happy for the fact that i started beti bachao beti padhao from haryana where as the sex ratio worsened the number of girl child went down in proportion to thousand males it was a huge concern as social balance was in danger and when i picked haryana many of our officers told me to do away with that saying there was a huge negative atmosphere in the state but i persisted and today i greet haryana from the bottom of my heart for accepting this proposal and now the birth of girls is growing at a very rapid pace there i truly welcome the change brought in the social life there in the last edition of mann ki baat i talked about two things first why don t we being citizens clean the statues of great personalities we get very emotional to build statues but get careless thereafter and the second thing that i told was when there is a republic day how can we then put emphasis on duties and discuss it there have been plenty of discussions on rights and will continue to happen but there should also be discussions on the duties i am happy that people from many places social organizations educational institutions few saints came forward to clean the statues and their premises it has been a good start and this is not only a swachta abhiyan it also is samman abhiyan i am not mentioning about everyone here but the news that has been received is highly satisfying few people perhaps do not give information due to hesitation i urge all those people to send photos of the statues cleaned by them on the portal mygov in as people from around the world can see that and feel honored in the same way i asked for views on duties and rights on january 26 and i am happy that thousands of people participated in it my dear countrymen i need a help from you and i believe that you will come along with me a lot is being said in the name of farmers in our country well i don t want to embroil into this controversy however the biggest crisis of farmers is the sheer waste of their efforts in the natural disaster his year goes waste there is only one solution that is to provide security to farmers and that is fasal beema yojana government of india has given a very big gift to the farmers in 2016 pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana but this is not meant to praise the scheme and the prime minister even though discussions have been happening on crop insurance for so many years not more than 20 25 per cent of the farmers across the country have become its beneficiary and get connected with the same can we pledge to reach out to at least 50 percent of the country s farmers with the crop insurance over the next 1 2 years i need your help in this exercise if a farmer gets linked to the crop insurance scheme he gets a big help in the times of crisis let me tell you pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana has got a lot of public acceptance as it is very comprehensive simple and with technological inputs and not only this even if something happens within 15 days of crop harvesting even then assurances for support is provided focus has been on using the technology to fast track it and ensure there is no delay in receiving the insurance claims on the top of it the insurance premium rate has been slashed to its lowest level which no one would have ever thought of in the new insurance scheme for the farmers the maximum limit of premium would be 2 percent for kharif and 1 5 percent for the rabi crops and tell me if any of my farmer brothers is deprived of the scheme then will it be damaging for him or not you may not be a farmer but must be listening to mann ki baat will you make my voice reach the farmers and therefore i want that you promote it the most and for this i have also brought a new scheme i want that my talks regarding pradhan mantri fasal beema yojana reaches the masses and it is right that you are listening to my mann ki baat on tv and radio but what if you have to listen to it later here is gift from my side you can listen to my mann ki baat on mobile phone at anytime all you have to do is just give a missed call from your mobile phone the number kept for mann ki baat is 8190881908 eight one nine zero eight eight one nine zero eight just give a missed call and you will be able to listen to maan ki baat whenever you want to as of now it is in hindi but very soon you would get the opportunity to listen to mann ki baat in your mother tongue i will arrange for this as well my dear youngsters you have done a commendable job i experienced new energy new consciousness new zeal and new vigour during the start up program which was held on january 16 lakhs of people had registered to attend this event however due to space constraint the program was eventually held in vigyan bhawan many of you couldn t make it but we ensured that you are able to participate in the event for the entire day online it is rare to find that a program keeps lakhs of young people engaged for so many hours but it happened and i was a witness to the kind of excitement start ups has there is a misconception among the people that start up means it related talks very sophisticated business the start up event cleared this misconception let me tell you start up around it is a small part life is big needs are endless start up also brings innumerable opportunities i visited sikkim few days ago sikkim has now become an organic state and i had invited the country s agriculture ministers and secretaries there i got the chance to meet two young individuals there who have studied from iim one is anurag agarwal and other is sidhi karnani they have ventured towards start up and met me in sikkim they work in agriculture field in north east and do the global marketing of herbal and organic produce that s a great job last time i told people associated with start up to narrate their experiences and send it to me on narendra modi app many have sent but i will be delighted if many more people come forward let me tell you the narratives which i have received so far are truly inspiring there is young guy named vishwas dwivedi he has an online kitchen start up and he undertakes the work of transporting tiffins to the middle class people who have gone out for jobs through online networking then there is one dignesh pathak he has made up his mind to work for the farmers especially the animal feed if our animals get good feed then we will get good milk and if we get good milk then the young people of our country will be powerful manoj gilda nikhilji have started agri storage start up they are developing the bulk storage system for agricultural products with scientific fruits storage system means lots of suggestions have come and you send more i will feel good and if i have to talk about start up repeatedly in my mann ki baat like i do every time for cleanliness will do so for startups as well as your power is our inspiration my dear countrymen cleanliness is also getting associated with beauty we kept expressing anguish against the filth for so many years but it didn t disappear now people of the country have started discussion on cleanliness leaving behind the filth and somewhere or the other something or the other work is happening on cleanliness but now people have marched one step ahead in the initiative they have added beauty with cleanliness in a way this is doubly beneficial and it is especially seen at the railway stations i see that many local people local artists students are engaged in decorating the railway stations of their cities keeping the local art at the centre painting the walls making artistic sign boards with content to keep people aware and so many other things being undertaken by the people someone told me that the tribal women have decrorated the hazaribagh station with the local sohrai and kohbar art design over 300 volunteers of thane district decorated the king circle matunga borivali khar stations many news are coming from rajasthan sawai madhopur kota it seems that our railway stations in themselves will become the identity of our tradition nobody will search tea and pakoda walas through the windows sitting on the train on the walls one can see the specialty of the place this was neither the initiative of the railways nor narendra modi this was the people s initiative see when people do and how well they do i see that i have got some pictures but i want to see many more pictures can you who have take some effort of cleaning along with decoration on railway station or other places send me the pictures do send those i will definitely see people will also see and others will also get inspiration and whatever can happen on the railway station can happen on the bus station hospitals schools near temples churchs mosques gardens etc whoever brought this thought started and promoted it deserves a compliment but yes do send me the photos i also want to see what you have done my dear countrymen it is a matter of pride that india is hosting a major event from 4th to 8th of february the entire world is coming and our navy is making a whole hearted effort to become a good host warships naval ships of many countries are gathering at the coastal region of vishakapatnam andhra pradesh international fleet review is happening on the coastal region of india this is an effort to ensure rapport between us and world s military power this is a joint exercise it is a very big opportunity in the coming days you will get to know about this through tv media as it will be a very big programme and everyone will emphasize on it this is very important for a country like india which has a golden coastal history they say sea as udhi or sagar in sanskrit this means endless sufficency borders and land may be separating us but water connects us sea connects us we can connect ourselves with sea we can connect with anyone by sea and our ancestors made the introduction of this power by roaming around the world doing global trade be it chatrapati shivaji chola dynasty which made a new identity with naval power even today there are many states where several cultures associated with sea exists and are celebrated with zest when the world is becoming our guest the power of the navy is getting introduced this is a good opportunity i will also get the fortune to be present on this global event in the similar way south asian federation games involving saarc nations is going to be held in guwahati thousands of saarc countries players are coming to the land of guwahati there is an atmosphere and excitement of sports a grand celebration from the new generation of saarc countries is happening on the land of guwahati in assam this also is a good opportunity to make relations with the saarc countries my dear countrymen i had even said earlier that whatever comes to mind i want to express it with you openly final examinations for grade 10th and 12th will be conducted in the coming days last time i had shared my views with the students regarding the examinations it is my wish that the students who have got the success share their

wholesome life and this is just what mann ki baat is today is the last day of january 2021 are you too thinking the way i am that 2021 had commenced just a few days ago it just doesn t feel that the entire month of january has passed by this is what is termed as the speed of time it feels like just a matter of a few days ago when we were exchanging good wishes with each other then we celebrated lohri makar sankranti pongal and bihu it was festival time in different parts of the country we celebrated the 23rd of january the birth anniversary of netaji subhash chandra bose as parakram diwas and also watched the grand republic day parade on the 26th of january following the address to the joint session by rashtrapati ji the budget session has also begun amidst all of this there was one more happening that is keenly awaited by all of us that is the announcement of the padma awards the nation honored people doing extraordinary work for their achievements and contribution to humanity this year too the recipients comprise people who have done excellent work in myriad fields through their endeavour they ve changed someone s life taking the country forward thus the tradition of conferring the padma honour on unsung heroes that was started a few years ago has been maintained this time too i urge all of you to know more about these people and their contribution discuss it amongst the family you will see how this inspires everyone this month there has been very good news from the cricket pitch too our cricket team after initial setbacks made a grand comeback winning the series in australia the hard work and teamwork of our players is inspirational amidst all this the country was saddened by the insult to the tricolor on the 26th of january in delhi we have to infuse times to come with new hope and novelty last year we displayed exemplary patience and courage this year too we have to work hard to attain our resolves we have to take our country forward at a faster pace my dear countrymen the beginning of this year marks the completion of almost one year of our battle against corona just as india s fight against corona became an example our vaccination programme too is turning out to be exemplary to the world today india is undertaking the world s biggest covid vaccine programme do you know what s a matter of more pride along with the biggest vaccine programme we are vaccinating our citizens faster than anywhere in the world in just 15 days india has vaccinated over 30 lakh corona warriors whereas an advanced country such as america took 18 days to get the same done britain 36 days friends today the made in india vaccine is of course a symbol of india s self reliance it is also a symbol of her self pride on namoapp bhai himanshu yadav from up has written that the made in india vaccine has generated a new self confidence within kirti ji writes from madurai that many of her foreign friends are messaging her thanking india kirti ji s friends have written to her that the way india has helped the world in the fight against corona has enhanced the respect for india in their hearts kirti ji listening to these notes of glory for the country also fills the listeners of mann ki baat with a sense of pride these days i too receive similar messages for india from presidents and prime ministers of different countries of the world you must also have seen recently how the president of brazil in a tweet thanked india every indian was gladdened at that people residing thousands of kilometers away in remote corners of the world are deeply aware of that context in ramayan they are intensely influenced by it this is a speciality of our culture friends in this vaccination programme you must have noticed something more during the moment of crisis india is able to serve the world today since she is capable self reliant in the field of medicines vaccines the same thought underpins the atmanirbhar bharat campaign the more india is capable the more will she serve humanity correspondingly the world will benefit more my dear countrymen every time lots of your letters are received one gets to know about your thoughts through your messages on namo app and mygov and phone calls one amongst these messages caught my attention this is from sister priyanka pandey ji 23 year old beti priyanka ji is a student of hindi literature and resides at siwan in bihar priyanka ji has written on namo app that she was highly inspired by my suggestion of visiting 15 domestic tourist places in the country and hence on the 1st of january she started for a destination which was very special the place was 15 kilometers away from her home it was the ancestral residence of the country s first president dr rajendra prasad ji priyanka ji has beautifully mentioned that this was her first step in the realm of acquainting herself with the country s great luminaries there priyanka ji came across many books written by dr rajendra prasad and many historical photographs as well really priyanka ji this experience of yours will inspire others too friends this year india is going to commence the celebration of 75 years of her independence amrit mahotsav in this context this is an excellent time to explore places associated with those heroes on account of whom we attained freedom friends as we refer to the freedom movement and bihar i would like to touch upon another comment made on namo app jai ram viplava a resident of munger has written to me about the tarapur martyr day on 15th of february 1932 the britishers had mercilessly killed several of a group of brave young patriots their only crime was that they were raising the slogan of vande matram and bharat mata ki jai i bow to those martyrs and remember their courage with reverence i want to thank jai ram viplava ji he has brought to the notice of the country an incident about which not as much discussion happened as should have been done my dear countrymen the freedom struggle was fought with full might in every part every city every town and village of india in every corner of this land bharatbhoomi great sons and brave daughters were born who gave up their lives for the nation hence it is very important that we preserve the saga of their struggles for our sake and their memories and for this we can write about them to keep their memories alive for generations to come i appeal to all countrymen especially the young friends to write about freedom fighters incidents associated with freedom write books about the saga of valour during the period of freedom struggle in your area now as india will celebrate 75 years of her freedom your writings will be the best tribute to those heroes of our freedom an initiative has been taken for young writers for the purpose of india seventy five this will encourage young writers of all states and of all languages writers who write on such subjects who have studied deeply indian heritage and culture will come forth in large numbers in the country we have to fully help such emerging talents this will also prepare a category of thought leaders that will decide the course of the future i invite my young friends to be a part of this initiative and to use their literary skills more and more information about this can be accessed from the website of the ministry of education my dear countrymen what the listeners of mann ki baat like only you know better but for me the best thing that i like in mann ki baat is that i get to learn and read a lot in a way indirectly i get an opportunity to connect with you all someone s effort somebody s zeal someone s passion to achieve something for the country all this inspires me a lot fills me with energy i felt very happy on reading about how a local vegetable market in boinpalli of hyderabad is fulfilling its responsibility all of us have seen that in vegetable markets a lot of produce gets spoilt for a variety of reasons the vegetables spread all around it spreads filth too but the vegetable market of boinpalli decided that it will not throw away the leftover vegetables just like that people associated with the vegetable market decided that they will generate electricity from this you may have hardly heard of generating electricity from waste vegetables this is the power of innovation today in boinpalli vegetable market what was once a waste wealth is getting created from that this is the journey of creation of wealth from waste nearly 10 tonnes of waste is generated there every day which is collected in a plant in this plant 500 units of electricity is generated every day and about 30 kilos of bio fuel too is generated the vegetable market is illuminated through this electricity and the bio fuel that is generated is used to cook food in the market canteen isn t it a wonderful effort a similar amazing feat has been achieved by the badaut village panchayat of panchkula in haryana this panchayat faced the problem of water drainage because of this dirty water was spilling around spreading disease but people of badaut decided that they would create wealth even from this water waste the village panchayat started filtering the dirty water coming from the village after collecting it at a place and this filtered water is now being used for irrigation by the farmers of the village thereby liberating them from pollution filth and disease and irrigating the fields too friends an example of how protection of environment can open avenues of income was seen in tawang in arunachal pradesh too for centuries a type of paper called mon shugu is made in this hilly region of arunachal pradesh the locals here make this paper from the bark of a plant named shugu sheng hence trees do not have to be cut to make this paper besides no chemical is used in making this paper thus this paper is safe for the environment and for health too there was a time when this paper was exported but with modern techniques large amount of paper started getting made and this local art was pushed to the brink of closure now a local social worker gombu has made an effort to rejuvenate this art this is also giving employment to tribal brothers and sisters there i have seen another news from kerala that makes us realise our responsibilities in kottayam of kerala there is an elderly divyang n s rajappan sahab due to paralysis rajappan is incapable of walking but this has not affected his commitment to cleanliness for the past several years he has been going by boat in vembanad lake and taking out the plastic bottles thrown into the lake think how great rajappan ji s thought is taking inspiration from rajappan ji we too should wherever possible make our contribution to cleanliness my dear countrymen you must have witnessed a few days ago that four women pilots from india took command of a non stop flight from san francisco america to bangalore travelling more than ten thousand kilometres this flight ferried more than two hundred and fifty passengers to india you must have also observed this time in the 26th january parade where two women officers of the indian air force created new history whatever be the area the participation of the women of the country is continuously on the rise but often we see that there is not much discussion of similar changes occurring in the villages of the country so when i got this news from jabalpur in madhya pradesh i felt that i must make a mention of it in mann ki baat this news is very inspiring in chichgaon jabalpur some tribal women were working on daily wages in a rice mill just like the corona pandemic affected every person in the world these women were also affected work stopped in their rice mill naturally their income got affected as well but they did not get disheartened they did not give up they decided that collectively they would start their own rice mill the mill where they worked wanted to sell its machine too one among these women meena rahangadale ji formed a self help group by associating all the women and all of them raised capital from their savings whatever amount of money was short was sourced under the aegis of ajivika mission in the form of a loan from the bank and now see these tribal sisters bought the same rice mill in which they once worked today they are running their own rice mill within this very period this mill has also earned a profit of about three lakh rupees with this profit meena ji and her colleagues are arranging to repay the bank loan and then seeking avenues to expand their business such amazing efforts have taken place in every corner of the country to counter whatever circumstances corona created my dear countrymen if i mention bundelkhand to you what are the things that will come to your mind those interested in history will connect this area with rani lakshmibai of jhansi at the same time some people will think of beautiful and serene orchha and some people will also remember the extreme heat conditions of this region but these days something different is happening here which is quite heartening and about which we must know recently a month long strawberry festival began in jhansi everyone is surprised strawberry and bundelkhand but this is the truth now there is growing enthusiasm about the cultivation of strawberry in bundelkhand and one of jhansi s daughters gurleen chawla has played a huge role in it a law student gurleen carried out strawberry cultivation successfully first at her home and then in her farm raising the hope that this was possible in jhansi too jhansi s strawberry festival emphasizes the stay at home concept through this festival farmers and youth are being encouraged to do gardening and grow strawberries in the vacant spaces behind their home or in the terrace garden with the help of new technology similar efforts are also being done in other parts of the country strawberry which was once identified with the hills is now also being cultivated in the sandy soil of kutch boosting the income of farmers friends experiments like the strawberry festival not only demonstrate the spirit of innovation they also demonstrate the manner in which the agricultural sector of our country is adopting new technologies friends the government is committed to modernizing agriculture and is also taking many steps in that direction the efforts of the government shall also continue in future my dear countrymen just a few days ago i watched a video that video was of sarmuddin a painter from naya pingla village in west midnapore west bengal he was expressing happiness that his painting based on ramayana had sold for two lakh rupees this brought great happiness to his fellow villagers too after watching this video i was curious to know more about it in this very context i came to know about a very good initiative related to west bengal which i would definitely like to share with you the regional office of the ministry of tourism started an incredible india weekend getaway in the villages of bengal at the beginning of the month the handicraft artisans from west midnapore bankura birbhum purulia east bardhaman organized handicraft workshop for visitors i was also told that the total sales of handicrafts during the incredible india weekend getaways is very encouraging to the handicraft artisans people are also making our art forms popular employing novel methods across the country look at bhagyashree sahu of rourkela odisha although she is a student of engineering in the past few months she started learning the art of pattchitra and has mastered it but did you know where she began painting soft stones on soft stones on her way to college bhagyashree found these soft stones she collected and cleaned them later she painted these stones in pattachitra style for two hours every day after painting these stones she started gifting them to her friends during the lockdown she started painting on bottles too and now she even conducts workshops on this art form a few days ago on the birth anniversary of subhash babu bhagyashree paid him a unique tribute done on stone i wish her all the best for her future endeavours a lot new can be learnt and done through art and colours i was informed of a similar novel initiative being carried out in dumka jharkhand a principal of a middle school there in order to teach and help the children learn got the village walls painted with the letters of the english and hindi alphabets alongside various pictures have also been painted which are helping the village children a lot i extend my greetings to all such individuals who are involved in such initiatives my dear countrymen thousands of kilometers from india across many oceans and continents lies a country chile it takes a lot of time to reach chile from india however the fragrance of indian culture has been there for a long time another significant aspect is that yoga is extremely popular there you will be pleased to know that there are more than 30 yoga schools in santiago the capital of chile the international day of yoga is also celebrated with great fervor in chile i have been told that the house of deputies is full of ardent enthusiasm for the yoga day in these times of corona with a stress on immunity and ways to strengthen it through the power of yoga now they are attaching much more importance to yoga the chilean congress that is their parliament has passed a proposal there the 4th of november has been declared as national yoga day now you would be wondering what is so special about 4th of november on 4th of november 1962 the first yoga institution in chile was established by jos rafael estrada by proclaiming this day as national yoga day a tribute has been paid to estrada ji this is a special honour by the chilean parliament which every indian takes pride in by the way there is another aspect about the chilean parliament one which will interest you the name of the vice president of the chilean senate is rabindranath quinteros he has been so named inspired by vishwa kavi gurudev rabindranath tagore my dear countrymen i have been requested by dr swapnil mantri from jalna maharashtra and prahlad rajgopalan from palakkad kerala on mygov to speak on road safety in mann ki baat this very month from the 18th of january to the 17th of february our country is observing road safety month road accidents are a matter of concern not just in our country but also the world over today in india many efforts are being made for road safety at the individual and collective level along with the government we should all become active stakeholders in these efforts to save lives friends you must have noticed passing through the roads that the border road organization builds one gets to see many innovative slogans slogans such as this is highway not runway or be mr late than late mr are quite effective in promoting awareness about being careful on the roads now you can also send such innovative slogans or catch phrases on mygov good slogans from you too will be used in this campaign friends whilst speaking about road safety i would like to mention a post received on namo app from aparna das ji of kolkata aparna ji has asked me to speak on the fastag programme she says that the experience of travel has changed with fastag this saves not just travel time problems like stopping at toll plaza worrying about cash payment are also over aparna ji is right too earlier a vehicle used to take on an average 7 to 8 minutes to cross our toll plazas however since the emergence of fastag this time has reduced to around one and a half minutes to 2 minutes on an average due to this reduced waiting time at the toll plaza fuel too is being saved it is estimated that this will save approximately 21 thousand crore rupees of our countrymen that is saving money as well as time i urge all of you to follow all the guidelines take care of yourself and also save the lives of others friends it is said here meaning that drop by drop the pot gets filled every single effort of ours leads to the realization of our resolve therefore the goals with which we started in 2021 we all have to fulfill them together come let us all work together to make this year meaningful do keep sending your messages your ideas we will meet again next month iti vidaa punarmilanaay do

31-Jul-16,"On July 31, 2016, in his address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized the importance of supporting Indian athletes participating in the upcoming Rio Olympics. He encouraged every citizen to rally behind the athletes, acknowledging the immense dedication and hard work they put in to reach that stage. The Prime Minister shared a poem from a young poet, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, which conveyed well wishes for the Indian athletes and their success at the Olympics.

He also paid tribute to the late President Abdul Kalam and highlighted the government's efforts to promote research and innovation in the field of technology. The Atal Innovation Mission was introduced to encourage an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly in the areas of science and technology.

Regarding current issues, Prime Minister Modi expressed concern about flooding in parts of the country and reminded citizens to be proactive in preventing diseases like dengue, especially during the monsoon season. He stressed the need to use antibiotics responsibly, complete the full course of medication as prescribed, and raise awareness about antibiotic resistance.

Prime Minister Modi also discussed the Prime Minister Safe Motherhood Campaign, aimed at improving maternal health and childbirth outcomes. He urged poor families to take advantage of free health check-ups for pregnant women offered on the 9th of every month.

Moreover, the address touched on environmental conservation, with a focus on planting trees and creating vertical gardens to enhance the beauty of railway stations and promote greener infrastructure. The Prime Minister praised the citizens' efforts in this regard.

In the digital age, the address also brought attention to the issue of online fraud and scams, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and caution in protecting against such threats.

As the rainy season coincides with festive celebrations, Prime Minister Modi encouraged the gifting of insurance policies for the safety and security of loved ones during the festival of Raksha Bandhan. Additionally, he invited suggestions and ideas from the citizens for his upcoming Independence Day speech, aiming to make it a collective and inclusive address.",31-jul-2016 my dear countrymen namaskar early this morning i had an opportunity to spend some time with some young people from delhi and i believe in the days to come the spirit and fervor of sports will envelop every young person in the country all of us know that in a few days time the world s largest sports event the biggest sports carnival will take place rio is going to resound in our ears time and again the entire world will be at play every country in the world will keep a close watch on the performance of its sportspersons you too will be doing the same all of us harbour a lot of hopes and expectations but keeping the morale of our sports contingent at rio high is also the solemn duty of us 1 25 billion countrymen in delhi this morning the government of india had organised a very good event run for rio play and live play and blossom in the days to come wherever we are let us do our bit to encourage our sportspersons a sportsperson who makes it to this stage does so after putting in a lot of hard work it s a kind of severe and dedicated tapasya however much one cherishes all kinds of food one has to sacrifice that however much one would like to snuggle up in warmth during a harsh winter one has to just get up and leave for the track and field and this happens not just to the players even their parents leave no stone unturned for the sake of their children sportsperson are not made overnight it takes long and sustained perseverance to attain that stature victory and defeat are certainly important but what is even more important is reaching this level in a game or sports discipline and therefore let all of us indians join hands in wishing our rio contingent the very best i m also ready to do this on your behalf the prime minister of the country is ready to be a postman to convey your good wishes to these players do send your best wishes to our sportspersons in rio on the narendramodi app i ll convey these to our contingent just like 1 25 billion indians i too as a citizen would like to join you in encouraging them cheering them up come over the next few days let us try to the fullest extent possible to make each one of our sportspersons feel proud to reward them for their endeavours and exertions and today as i speak on the rio olympics i would like to mention the name of a poetry lover suraj prakash upadhyay a student of the punjab central university who has sent me a poem it s possible that many poets would have written poems some may be planning to write some may even compose their verses into songs in all languages but here i would like to share with you the poem sent by suraj ji the games bugle s been sounded the festivities of competitions in this mega sporting odyssey amidst the melodious chimes of rio may india commence on a grand note may it rain gold silver and bronze may india commence on a grand note may it rain gold silver and bronze may the turn be ours also this time may we be amply prepared this time set your sight straight at the gold but let a loss not deject you you are a hero to a billion hearts you are the heartbeat of your sport march ahead and set records let our tricolour flutter with pride in rio let our tricolour flutter with pride in rio suraj ji i dedicate your sentiments to all our sportspersons and extend to them the warmest and heartiest wishes from my side and on behalf of us 1 25 billion countrymen that our tricolour indeed flutters with joy and pride in the skies of rio a young man mr ankit has reminded me of the death anniversary of president abdul kalamji which was observed last week the country in fact the world paid glowing tributes to him the mere mention of abdul kalamji s name brings to mind vivid images of science technology missiles in fact the entire spectrum of strengths and capabilities of india in the days to come and that s why ankit asks me what is your government doing to ensure that abdul kalamji s dreams come true you are right the future is going to be technology driven and technology is extremely dynamic day by day technology keeps updating changes form transforms its impact you cannot shackle technology if you strive to hold it still it would move beyond your grasp assuming new looks and forms if we have to match its strides and move ahead research and innovation are the keys these are its lifelines and moving spirit in the absence of research and innovation technology will become a burden just as still water stagnates and even stinks and if we go on just using old technology without recourse to research and innovation we will become outdated in this rapidly changing world and age and that is why the government too has taken steps to attract the new generation toward science and research innovation in the field of technology and that is why i say let us aim to innovate and when i say let us aim to innovate my aim stands for atal innovation mission this mission is being promoted by the niti aayog the purpose is to create an eco system in the entire country through the atal innovation mission to forge a vibrant chain of innovation experiment and entrepreneurship which would also enhance the possibilities of new employment generation if we have to develop the next generation innovators we shall have to link our children with it and that is why the government of india has taken the initiative of atal tinkering labs wherever such tinkering labs are established in schools those would be given 10 lakh rupees and further 10 lakh rupees will be provided for maintenance during the period of five years similarly innovations are directly connected to incubation centres if we have strong and well equipped incubation centres a system comes into place for innovations for start ups for experimentation and to bring these efforts to a certain level creation of new incubation centres is essential just as it is necessary to strengthen the older incubation centres and when i talk of atal incubation centres the government has considered allocating the huge sum of 10 crore rupees for this also india is grappling with diverse challenges we see problems in daily life we shall now have to look for technological solutions for these through the atal grand challenges we have exhorted the young generation of the country that if they see problems they should search for solutions taking the path of technology doing research applying innovations and bring those on board the government of india wants to specially reward technology developed to find solutions to our problems and i am happy that people have evinced interest in these things when we spoke of tinkering labs about 13 thousand schools applied and when we talked of incubation centres over four thousand academic and non academic institutions came forward i firmly believe that the real tribute to abdul kalamji will consist of harnessing research and innovation for developing technology to find solutions to problems we face in day to day life and ridding us of the difficulties we face to make things easier for us all the more the new generation devotes itself to this task the greater will be their contribution with immense significance for the modern india of the 21st century that will be the real tribute to abdul kalamji my dear countrymen while some time ago we were concerned about a drought like situation these days on the one hand we are enjoying the rains but on the other reports of floods are also coming in central government and state governments are working hand in hand with their utmost efforts to provide relief and assistance to the flood affected despite causing some hardships rains make every human heart rejoice since rains and agriculture are the focal point of our entire sphere of economic activities there are times when one has to face an illness that leaves a scar for a lifetime but if we are aware alert and active the prevention is also very easy take the case of dengue it is preventable pay attention to cleanliness be alert try and be safe and take special care of children and the mindset that such diseases strike poor neighborhoods only is not valid in the case of dengue dengue first enters affluent localities and we should try and understand it you must be watching advertisements on tv but there are times when we neglect taking proactive and informed action on it the government hospitals doctors will of course do their job but i urge that we should also be alert in ensuring that dengue doesn t enter our homes locality family for that matter any illness connected with stagnant water i would like to draw the attention of my dear countrymen to another menace in today s fast paced rat race of life at times we don t have time to think about ourselves when we fall sick we want to get well as soon as possible and as a result pop in just any antibiotic that we can lay our hands on it may give you instant relief but my dear countrymen this random pill popping habit can land you in deep trouble it may give you temporary succor but we should completely stop taking antibiotics without the advice of a doctor avoid it till a doctor gives you a prescription do not use the short cut method it can lead to serious complications although random and rampant use of antibiotics gives immediate relief to the patient but gradually the disease causing bacteria get accustomed to that drug the drug then loses its efficacy and one has to fight the battle anew develop new medicines do new research it takes years and till then these diseases create other complications that s why we have to be very aware about that one more problem has presented itself suppose the doctor advises that brother take this antibiotic and he tells that 15 tablets of that to be taken over a period of five days i urge you to complete the entire course of medication as prescribed by the doctor because if the treatment is abandoned halfway it would benefit the bacteria if the medicine is taken more than what is required that too would be in the favour of the bacteria and that is why it is utmost essential to take the entire course of antibiotic medicine in terms of number of tablets as well as days if we leave the treatment halfway due to improvement in our condition we are only helping that bacteria getting more sturdy and difficult to treat microbes spreading tb and malaria are bringing about rapid mutations in themselves rendering medicines ineffective in medical parlance it is called antibiotic resistance hence it is indeed necessary to follow rules in the administration of antibiotics the government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance you must have seen these days on the antibiotic medicine strips there is a red line to make you aware you must pay attention to that while we are on the subject of health i would like to talk about one more issue i feel very concerned about the lives of pregnant women of our country in our country close to 3 crore women become pregnant every year but some of these mothers die during childbirth sometimes the mother loses her life at times the infant does there are times when both die it is true that in the last decade there has been a decline in maternal mortality rates but even now we are not able to save the lives of a large number of pregnant women anemia during or after pregnancy pregnancy related infections high bp any such complication can have devastating effect keeping in view these issues in the last few months the government of india has launched a new campaign prime minister safe motherhood campaign under this on the 9th of every month all pregnant women will get a check up at government health centers free of cost i urge all poor families to ensure that all pregnant women avail of this benefit on the 9th of every month so that if by the time they reach the 9th month any complication arises it can be dealt with suitably in time and the lives of both mother and child can be saved i have specially asked the gynecologists whether they could offer their services free on the 9th of every month for the sake of under privileged mothers can t my doctor brothers and sisters spare just 12 days in a year for this service to the under privileged over the last few days many have written to me there are thousands of doctors who have implemented what i said but india is such a vast country we need lakhs of doctors to join this campaign i do believe that you will indeed do so my dear countrymen today the whole world is concerned deeply about climate change global warming and the environment these are discussed collectively in the country and across the world in india this has been accorded great importance for centuries in the battlefield of kurukshetra too bhagwan shri krishna talks of trees showing concern towards trees even in the midst of a battle underlines how much importance was attached to trees in the gita bhagwan shri krishna says ashwatth sarvvrikshanam which means amongst all trees i am the peepal tree it is proclaimed in shukracharya neeti that naastimulam anaushadham meaning that there is no plant that does not have medicinal values the anushasan parv of the mahabharta elaborates this concept at greater length it is stated in the anushasan parv that whosoever plants a tree begets an offspring in the form of that tree there can be no doubt about this fact he who donates a tree that tree in return becomes a ladder to salvation just like children therefore it is appropriate that parents desiring their well being should plant tree and rear them like their own children our scriptures like gita shukracharya niti and anushasan parv of the mahabharta contain such lofty ideals however there are certain individuals in the present generation also who live up to these ideals a few days ago i came across a mention of sonal a young daughter from pune it touched my heart it is mentioned in anushasan parv in mahabharata that a tree is like an offspring and becomes means of salvation in after life sonal has not only taken it upon herself to fulfill her parents wishes but society s expectations also shri khandu maruti mhatre a farmer of narayanpur village of of junner taluka of pune got his granddaughter sonal married in a very inspiring manner what did mhatre ji do in sonal s marriage he gifted all his relatives guests and friends with a sapling of kesar variety of mango i saw a picture of this marriage in social media i was surprised to see that in the marriage festivities instead of members of the wedding party saplings were more visible that picture really touches one s heart i think that sonal who herself is an agriculture graduate came upon this idea and to present mango saplings in the marriage just think reflects the love for nature in a brilliant manner in a way sonal s marriage in an everlasting story of love for nature i congratulate sonal and shriman mhatre ji for this innovative effort and such experiments are done by many people i remember when i was the chief minister of gujarat the temple of ambaji there is visited in the month of bhadrapad by lakhs of devotees travelling by foot a certain ngo decided to distribute saplings as prasad to the devotees and the devotees were told that mata ambaji will keep on showering her grace if they took care of the saplings till their maturity into trees in their homes and villages and lakhs of such saplings were distributed to the devotees traveling on foot to ambaji temple that year other temples too can start the practice of distributing saplings instead of prasad during this rainy season it can easily grow into a people s movement for planting trees i repeatedly tell my farmer brethren that instead of wasting our land in building fences around our fields why don t we start planting timber trees there today india has to spend billions and trillions of rupees to import timber wood from abroad for construction of houses and furniture if we plant on the boundaries of our fields timber trees that can be utilised for construction of homes and furniture and which can also be cut and sold after 15 to 20 years with the permission of the government this way not only can these become a new source of your income but can also save india from importing timber some days ago a few states taking advantage of this weather have started many campaigns in this direction and the government of india has also passed campa law under which about 40 thousand crores rupees will go to the states for planting trees i have been told that the maharashtra government planted about 2 crores sapling in the entire state on 1st july and next year they have taken a pledge to plant about 3 crores trees the maharashtra government has transformed this activity into a people s movement rajasthan desert area has celebrated van mahotsav in a very big way and pledged to plant 25 lakhs trees to plant 25 lakhs of sapling in rajasthan is not a small matter those who know the soil conditions of rajasthan would know how mammoth this task is going to be andhra pradesh too has decided to increase its green cover by 50 by the year 2029 under the central government s ongoing green india mission railways too have joined in this endeavour gujarat too has an illustrious tradition of observing van mahotsav this year gujarat has undertaken many projects like aamra van ekata van and shaheed van as a part of van mahotsav and launched a campaign to plant crores of trees i am not able to mention every state but all deserve to be appreciated my dear countrymen i had the opportunity to visit south africa for the first time some time back during a foreign visit diplomacy is practiced there are trade deliberations discussions about security and as is customary many mous are concluded but for me the visit to south africa was more like a pilgrimage when we think of south africa it is very natural to remember mahatma gandhi and nelson mandela whenever we hear the words non violence love and forgiveness the inspiring faces of gandhi and mandela appear before us during my south africa tour i visited phoenix settlement where mahatma gandhi s home is known as sarvodaya i also had the good fortune of traveling from pietermaritzburg station in the train in which mahatma gandhi had travelled and which was the site of the incidence that sowed the seed of the transformation of a mohandas into mahatma gandhi but what i want to tell you is the fact that this time i had an opportunity to meet those great men who had devoted their young lives for society fighting shoulder to shoulder with nelson mandela for the ideals of equality and equal opportunity who had spent 20 to 22 years of their lives in prison with nelson mandela effectively sacrificing the entire period of their youth for the society i had the privilege of meeting these grat personalities these close associates of nelson mandela such as shriman ahmed kathrada shriman laloo chiba shriman george bizos and ronnie kasrils all were indian by origin but dedicated themselves to wherever they settled and decided to offer their lives for those amidst whom they lived so much strength they had and the greatest thing was that while i was talking to them and listening about the experiences of their imprisonment they had no bitterness or ill will for anyone there was not a single trace of desire to get something to become somebody even after living such a great life of tapasaya the essence of performing one s duty as explained in gita was embodied in their persona i will remember that meeting forever equality and equal opportunity are the two biggest mantras for any society and government equality and equal opportunity compassion and fraternity these are the paths leading us to a bright future we all want a good future for our children everybody has different needs and different priorities but there is one common path of development equality compassion and fraternity come let us be proud about these indians who have lived their lives in south africa embodying our highest and fundamental ideals my dear countrymen i have received a message from shilpi varma to whom i am grateful her concern is very genuine she has made me aware of an incident pradhan mantri ji i am shilpi varma speaking from bengaluru some days ago i read in a news article that a lady became a victim of fraud and cheat email lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide being a woman i feel an empathy with her family what is your opinion about such cheat and fraud emails she has pointed a certain incident and you must also be aware that we get messages on our mobile phones and emails proclaiming attractive offers that you have won a jackpot of so many rupees if you pay a certain amount then you become eligible for the greater amount people get duped by this money trap these are new methods of technology that are spreading in the entire world for cheating people and just as technology plays an increasingly bigger role in our economic system it also invites those who misuse it a retired gentlemen who not only had to get his daughter married but also to build his home one day he received an sms that there was a gift that had arrived from abroad and could be obtained if he deposited 2 lakh rupees as custom duty in a bank account and this gentlemen without giving any thought took out 2 lakh rupees from his hard earned life savings and sent it to some stranger that too on the strength of just an sms and in very little time he understood that he had been looted you too must be getting similarly confused sometimes these people write a letter in such style that it seems perfect they use fake letter pads while sending these letters they obtain your credit card number and debit card number and empty your bank account through technology and this new means of fraud is digital fraud i believe that we must be aware against such lure must remain cautious and if such false communications come to our notice then we must share them with our friends and make them aware also shilpi varma has brought this important thing to my notice which although even you must have encountered but may be you did not take it that seriously but i feel there is need to look at it seriously my dear countrymen these days the parliament session is going on and during the parliament session i get to meet many people from across our nation our mps also bring people from their constituencies and introduce them to me they tell me many things their difficulties also but recently i had a pleasant experience real pleasant experience student from aligarh had come to meet me you should have seen the enthusiasm of those boys and girls they had brought a big photo album with them and their faces were lit with joy they showed me the pictures of how they had beautified the aligarh railway station these were artistic painting done on the station what is more they had searched for and collected the plastic bottles and oil cans lying in the garbage in the villages and by filling those with soil and planting saplings they have transformed those pots into a vertical garden and by creating this vertical garden on the site of railway station they have given it a new look if you go to aligarh do visit the railway station i am receiving news from many railway stations in the country where the local populace has taken to depicting on the walls of the railway stations their area s identity through means of their arts they have brought about a refreshing feeling this is a prime example of the great transformation which can be brought about through people s participation i felicitate all such citizens involved in these kinds of activities and especially congratulate friends from aligarh my dear countrymen with the onset of rainy season there is also an onset of festival season in our country there would be fairs everywhere festivities would be observed in temples and places of worship you too will become a participant at home and outside during the festive celebrations the festival of raksha bandhan is a festival of special significance just like last year can t you gift on the occasion of raksha bandhan pradhan mantri suraksha bima yojna or jeevan jyoti bima yojna to mothers and sisters of our country think about it we should gift such a present to our sisters which really provides her security in future not only that we may be having in our homes a lady making food for us or a lady who cleans our house a daughter of an impoverished mother to them also you can gift pradhan mantri suraksha bima yojna or jeevan jyoti bima yojna on this festival of raksha bandhan and this is what social security in reality is all about this is the true meaning of raksha bandhan my dear countrymen there are many among us who were born after independence and i am the first prime minister of this nation who was born in free india quit india movement started on 8th august and this year would be the 75th year of quit hind quit bharat and on 15th august it would be 70th year of our independence we are enjoying our independence and are proud to be free citizens

very special the reason for this is independence day this time when india will complete 75 years of her independence we are all going to be witness to a splendid and historic moment the almighty has blessed us with this great fortune think about it had we been born in the era of slavery then how would have we imagined this day that yearning of freedom from slavery the desperation for freedom from the shackles of subjugation how formidable it must have been those days when every single day we would be seeing millions of countrymen fighting battling making sacrifices for the sake of freedom then we would wake up every morning with this dream of when my india would be free and maybe that day would dawn in our lives when we would dedicate our lives to the generations to come chanting vande mataram and bharat maa ki jai spending our youth for the cause friends on the 31st of july i e today all of us countrymen salute the martyrdom of shaheed udham singh ji i offer my humble tributes to all such other great revolutionaries who sacrificed their all for the country friends i am very happy to see that the azadi ka amrit mahotsav is taking the form of a mass movement people from all walks of life and from every section of the society are participating in different programs connected with it one such event took place in meghalaya earlier this month people remembered the brave warrior of meghalaya u tirot singh on his death anniversary tirot singh ji fiercely opposed the british conspiracy to control the khasi hills and destroy the culture there many artists gave beautiful performances in this program they made history come alive a carnival was also organized as part of the event in which the great culture of meghalaya was depicted in a beautiful manner a few weeks ago in karnataka a unique campaign named amrita bharathi kannadarthi was also launched in this grand programs related to the azadi ka amrit mahotsav were organized at 75 places in the state in these along with remembering the great freedom fighters of karnataka efforts were also made to bring to the fore the local literary achievements friends in this very july an interesting endeavour has been undertaken named azadi ki railgadi aur railway station the objective of this effort is to make people know the role of indian railways in the freedom struggle there are many such railway stations in the country which are associated with the history of the freedom movement you too will be surprised to know about these railway stations gomoh junction in jharkhand is now officially known as netaji subhas chandra bose junction gomoh do you know why actually at this very station netaji subhash was successful in dodging british officers by boarding the kalka mail all of you must have heard the name of kakori railway station near lucknow the names of bravehearts like ram prasad bismil and ashfaq ullah khan are associated with this station the brave revolutionaries had displayed their might to the british by looting the treasury of the british being carried by train whenever you talk to the people of tamil nadu you will get to know about vanchi maniyachchi junction in thoothukudi district this station is named after tamil freedom fighter vanchinathan ji this is the same place where vanchi 25 years of age then had punished one british collector for his actions friends this list is pretty long 75 such railway stations have been identified spread over 24 states across the country these 75 stations are being decorated very ornately many types of programs are also being organized in these you should also take out time to visit one such historical station in your vicinity you will get to know in detail about pages from the history of the freedom movement that you have not been aware of i urge the students of the nearby school and the teachers to take the small children of their school to the station and narrate the whole chain of events to those children explaining them my dear countrymen under the azadi ka amrit mahotsav from the 13th to the 15th of august a special movement har ghar tiranga har ghar tiranga is being organized by becoming a part of this movement from august 13 to 15 you must hoist the tricolor at your home or adorn your home with it the tricolor connects us inspires us to do something for the country i also have a suggestion that from the 2nd of august to the 15th of august all of us can place the tricolor in our social media profile pictures by the way do you know 2nd of august also has a special connection with our tricolor this day is the birth anniversary of pingali venkaiah ji who designed our national flag i pay my respectful homage to him talking about our national flag i will also remember the great revolutionary madam cama her role in shaping the tricolor has been very important friends the biggest message that emerges from all these events being organized in the azadi ka amrit mahotsav is that all of us countrymen should follow our duty with full devotion only then will we be able to fulfill the dream of those countless freedom fighters and to build the india of their dreams that is why this amrit kaal of our next 25 years is kartavyakaal a period of duty for every countryman to liberate the country our brave fighters had given us this responsibility and we have to fulfill it fully my dear

we all know how useful indian traditional methods are in this in the fight against corona ayush has played an important role at the global level there is a growing interest in ayurveda and indian

the web more than one lakh specimens and scientific information related to them are available on this virtual herbarium in the virtual herbarium a rich picture of the botanical diversity of india is also visible i am sure the indian virtual herbarium will become an important resource for research on indian flora my dear countrymen every time in mann ki baat we discuss successes of the countrymen which bring smiles to our faces if a success story spreads sweet smiles and also tastes sweet you will certainly call it icing on the cake these days our farmers are performing similar wonders in the production of honey the sweetness of honey is also changing the lives of our farmers increasing their income in yamunanagar harayana there lives a beekeeper friend subhash kamboj ji subhash ji

increased the country started campaigns like national beekeeping and honey mission farmers worked hard and the sweetness of our honey started reaching across the world there are still huge possibilities in this field i would like our youth to join these opportunities and take advantage of them and realize new possibilities my dear countrymen i have received a letter from a listener of

nation and society.",31-may-2015 my dear countrymen last time when i addressed mann ki baat i was extremely distracted and upset by the earthquake that had struck then my mind did not allow me to speak but still i spoke mann ki baat today when i am addressing mann ki baat we are all surrounded by severe hot weather with all the heat related problems and news from all corners of the country i would like to request you all to take care of your health in this hot weather by following simple instructions such as drinking ample amount of water and covering yourself for protection from the heat at the same time i would also like to request you all to take care of the birds and animals in your neighbourhood and fulfill their requirements too we should take this opportunity to give the responsibility to our children to place a bowl of water for the birds in a suitable place where the water does not get heated up by doing this i can assure you that your children will imbibe good moral and cultural values moreover in this extreme heat this act will be a life saver for the birds and animals too this summer season is marked on one side by the extreme heat conditions while on the other side there is both happiness and sadness after completing our exams we are in a state of anxiety until the announcement of the results now cbse and the other boards have declared their results and i would like to congratulate each and every student who has passed with flying colours i came to know the significance of mann ki baat when many students after obtaining their exam results informed me that they listened carefully to my words on mann ki baat and followed them strictly during their exams which has in turn proven to be quite fruitful and beneficial well friends i am glad to know this through your letters however the true reason behind your success is not any mann ki baat but your hard work throughout the year and the consistent support from your entire family your school your teachers and many others have a role to play in your success and you have strived hard to attain this success in order to meet everybody s expectations mann ki baat is a kind of exam tip given before entering the examination hall however today i really enjoy the fact that mann ki baat has created a significant impact and i am very happy about it while i speak about happiness surrounding our friends who have passed with good scores i would also like to make a mention of many of our friends who may have got low scores and some of them who were not successful to all those who have passed i would like to remind them that they are in that stage of their lives where they can choose their career in the right direction now you have the opportunity to decide that right path for your career according to your wish and capabilities please also remember that your future will depend on the path which you choose generally i have observed that most of the students have no idea about what they should study why they need to study or where they should study they are also not aware of the aims in their lives many students mostly choose their career paths based on the opinions of their friends and families or based on the wishes of their parents our universe has expanded itself in all directions there are no limits for the choice of subjects or opportunities you must be careful and determined in choosing your career path in accordance with your talent and capabilities why do you always have to choose the prevailing opportunities try your best try to utilise the talents within you to gain new opportunities at the same time you should also think how you can contribute to the betterment of your nation from what you have learned or what you become you will be shocked to hear about the fact that as compared to the number of museums built around the world the number of museums in india is very few it is very difficult to find the right staff members for these museums as it is not a conventionally popular field i do not want to drag on one topic however my only point is that our nation is in dire need of excellent teachers soldiers scientists as well as artists and musicians the field of sports is very broad wherein other than players various eminent human resources are also required for the fulfilment of any sports activity this proves that we are surrounded by a vast variety of fields and opportunities on this planet we all must try with strong determination your strengths your capabilities your dreams all should be aligned to the dreams of our nation this is your only chance to choose your right path to those who have not succeeded i would like to tell them that success or failure is part of life those who consider failure as an opportunity always head towards the foundation of success those who give up in life due to failure can never reach the heights of success we can learn a lot from our failures why not we believe that our failures can provide us the opportunity to know ourselves better and understand our strengths and by knowing our strengths and talents we will be able to choose the right path in life i am reminded of our nation s ex president shri a p j abdul kalam in his book my journey transforming dreams into action he has mentioned an incident that took place in his life he says that he always aspired to become a pilot however when he tried to become a pilot he failed and could not clear his exams now you can see that his failure gave him a great opportunity in his life he became a great scientist of our nation he became the president of india and his contribution stands unparalleled in the field of nuclear energy in india therefore friends please do not bend yourselves under the burden of failure failure is a kind of opportunity do not let the failure go without learning a lesson from it try to search for a hope and opportunity that lies hidden in your failure this is my humble request to all my young friends and also to their family members if your son fails please do not create an atmosphere which can force him to lose all hopes in his life sometimes the children s failure is associated with their parents dream which leads to various problems in future it should not happen fighting with failures can provide us the strength to live our lives peacefully i would once again like to congratulate all my young friends who have passed out with flying colours i would also like to convey my thoughts to my young friends who have failed but i congratulate them to have obtained opportunities to find a right path in their lives please try and strive to move forward with hope and trust in your lives meanwhile many incidents have happened since my previous mann ki baat our government has completed one year the entire nation analysed us quite minutely and criticised us many people gave us a distinction for our governance in democracy i believe that it is very important to receive the feedback from the supporters and the opposition in politics we must try to understand the drawbacks and the areas where we lag behind it is also beneficial to understand our merits in my case i am happy with all that has happened so far my heart is always yearning to do something for the poor people in our country i always think of novel ideas and accept suggestions from others in order to help the poor last month we launched 3 key policies to provide social security to the people of our society i e prime minister s suraksha bima yojna prime minister s jeevan jyoti bima yojna and atal pension yojna it has been just twenty days since the launch of these policies and i can proudly say that due to your trust in our nation our government and our programmes and policies the common citizens of our country have joined hands with us in such huge numbers i am extremely happy in sharing the fact that within a short span of 20 days more than 8 crore and 52 lakhs people have registered their names for these programmes we have adopted important measures in the path of social security and it will act as a boon for the people in the future years for those who have not yet received this information i would like to request them to acquire these benefits as soon as possible no one could have imagined receiving suraksha bima yojna by investing just one rupee per month or 12 rupees in a year in order to get the benefits of jeevan jyoti bima yojna you need to invest just 330 rupees in a year which is less than a rupee per day therefore by using these benefits the poor will not be dependent on others for their living the poor will become independent and self confident we are adopting different measures in this direction i want to create an army of people my army comprising of poor people will fight against poverty and defeat it our nation has been burdened with poverty for years now and we will take appropriate steps to try and eliminate poverty from our nation we are sure we will succeed another most important development is the introduction of a channel for farmers on television and i am feeling happy about it we have a number of channels on televisions in our country such as cartoon channels sports channels news channels and entertainment channels for me the channel for farmers is very important as i can clearly see the future of farmers through this channel according to my view this channel is like an open university for farmers and their farms this is a channel where both students and teachers are farmers these farmers can learn a lot of things through excellent experience and move from traditional farming towards modern farming only minimal areas are left for farming the families of farmers are increasing in number but the land area is reducing due to this problem it is very critical to understand the ways to grow crops efficiently in such small areas now we can get details about the weather forecast and plan accordingly the channels for farmers will be focussing on these various issues my farmer brothers and sisters a system for monitoring farmers has been arranged in each of our districts please contact the respective district heads for availing this benefit i would like to speak to my fisherman brothers and sisters to all those who are involved with fishery there are many things for them to learn from this channel in india animal husbandry has been a traditional segment in a villager s life which acts as a supportive role in farming however as compared to the number of animals and the amount of milk production in various countries around the world india lacks far behind as compared to the numbers of animals the estimated amount of milk production is not achieved in our country the process by which we can produce more milk per animal the ways in which the animals can be taken care of and the types of food that should be provided to them are some the important factors to be considered we take various measures based on our traditions but we need to move forward by adopting scientific methods and technologies by adopting these scientific methods farmers as well as the animal husbandry can help us achieve financial strength in this way we can provide confidence and power to the farmers and also the animal keepers we should get scientific guidance regarding the direction in which we should move forward and attain success in this area my dear countrymen do you remember this date 21st june generally 21st june is remembered as the longest day of the year but recently this date has gained a new significance in the world in september last year i had raised a subject and proposed to celebrate 21st june as international yoga day while addressing the united nations assembly the whole world was astonished and you will also be surprised to know that within hundred days we got support from 177 countries and this proposal was successfully passed in the history of united nations such huge numbers of supporters from different countries were seen for the first time this proposal was passed in a very short span of time with the support of various countries around the world this is a proud moment for every indian now this is our responsibility would we have ever thought that yoga can act as a connecting link between nations vasudhaiv kutumbakam implies that our ancestors had imagined the same where yoga will act as a catalyst in connecting the world this is news of utmost happiness and pride for us but to achieve its real significance we need to project the real essence of yoga and its real strength to the entire world yoga connects the heart and mind and acts as a medium for freedom from ailments and lust i am realizing that yoga connects the body mind and knowledge now it is has been widely proven that yoga can also act as a medium for connecting the world why are we not taking steps to become an ambassador for this venture why not move forward in this path of human development with the help of this vital knowledge of yoga we must celebrate 21st june as yoga day in every corner of india please call up your relatives and friends staying in different parts of the world and ask them to gather in groups and celebrate yoga day if they have no knowledge of yoga ask them to take help from books read and explain the importance of yoga in our lives you can also read various letters on yoga i strongly believe that by declaring yoga day we have taken an important step in the development of the world we have contributed to human development by removing stress from the lives of people by providing positive energy to those who have lost all hopes in their lives i want that what world has accepted what world has respected and what world has given to india should be a matter of pride three weeks are left and you should take efforts and join and make others join i would especially like to speak to my soldiers of the army who are fighting for our country s safety they have joined the army for their living and have sacrificed their lives for our country here i am not speaking to them as a prime minister but from my inner self inner truth and deep emotions that i have for my soldiers questions about one rank and one pension have not been resolved or answered for over forty years there is no denial from the truth that the previous governments have spoken about this issue but have never done something about it i can assure you and i have also promised my army men that my government will surely launch one rank and one pension we know our responsibilities and after the formation of our government different departments have begun working on this issue i used to consider this to be a simple issue but it is far more complicated than i thought and for forty years this issue has been delayed in order to resolve this issue in a simpler direction i have asked the government officials to find solutions to this problem it is not necessary to provide information to media every single second there is no requirement to run a commentary for this issue i would like to assure you and i would like to repeat that our government will launch one rank and one pension and provide solutions to all related issues your life is very important to us owing to the thought process and ideals with which we are moving forward i would like to connect with you and help you not just as a part of any government programme or any political campaign but as a reflection of my patriotism i once again would like to convey to all the soldiers of my country that we are not one of those people who in the name of politics played games with you for the past forty years i am against this path and i am not willing to take any step which would complicate the existing issues i want you to trust me even if people are talking against us and playing games in the name of politics i would like to provide all the assistance to my people who are sacrificing their lives for the country these are my motives and i believe that the words from my soul which is made up of nothing but truth will touch your heart as well you have kept your patience intact for forty years i need some time and opportunity to work once again i would like to assure my countrymen that we will mutually work on this issue and find solutions for the same you all must have visited different parts of the country during vacations some of you must be planning now to visit places it is natural that seeing is believing when we visit places we may go to our relatives place or go sight seeing we get to explore and understand the world for a person who has just seen a pond in his village the experience of seeing an ocean cannot be expressed in words he is unable to describe the size of ocean in front of the villagers as seeing is altogether a different experience when in vacations while you are travelling with friends or family or planning to go i do not know if you have the habit of writing a diary while travelling i believe you must jot down your experiences when you meet new people and you should write down in words all that influenced you when you see something you should describe it in words in other words you must assimilate what you see or feel within you travelling is a form of knowledge in itself it is not possible for all of us to get a chance to climb the himalayas one must read the adventurous travel stories through the books written by those who have got a chance to visit the himalayas i am not saying that you should become a writer we should travel and write to learn something new to understand our country and to know its varied diversity we can write about a particular place the food habits of the people there their clothing style language and culture and also about their dreams aspirations and problems we are living in this vast nation if we want to understand the entire nation one life is not enough to do this it is my earnest request to all of you who are planning to visit or travel to share your travelling experiences with me i would be glad to read your stories i would request you to mail me your photo and your experience with incredible india and i will share your impressive stories with others i would like to feel what you have experienced i would to like see from far what you have seen during your travel you can visit a sea shore and take a walk alone though i may be unable to do this by reading your story i would love to share your vivid experience with
